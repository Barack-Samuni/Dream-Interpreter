I don't know whether it was football or volleyball. Naturally, after the game there were boys and girls, and one of the boys grabbed some girl and said, \"This is ...\" and he said a name and even an address and telephone number. Then I was someplace with a lady and she pointed to a dog and told me that this was a domestic animal, and then she would say that this animal was from the mountains and so on. She kept classifying them according to what she thought. This happened at my university and I was alone, although there were some girls that I knew.

After spending some time in the other two thirds, I wandered into the last third. It contained lots of tables set with examples from caterers; their place settings and samples of their food. Other tables had samples of wedding photo albums and other paraphernalia of weddings. Scattered here end there were mannequins with samples of wedding gowns. There was a group of around half a dozen of people 'shopping' for a wedding: looking over all the samples and discussing them with the bride, who was choosing which things she would have. It was closing time and the store's doors had been shut to prevent new customers from coming in. The employees told us that all the food from the caterers was going to be thrown away that night, so they encouraged us to try it all. We all went around and started eating, while the employees all stood around the far end, chatting and waiting for us to finish. I decided that since there was so may food I would only eat things that looked really good. Of this I only remember angel food cake with strawberries. By this time I had decided to concentrate on only eating deserts!",

I started to swim, but it was very hard because there was so many big, sharp rocks.  But in the middle of the ocean, there wasn't any rocks.,  I started to swim out, but there was a huge wave,  so I swam back.  While doing this I cut my toe.  I got to shore and I met Heleyna there.  She told me: \"Don't get in a boat here, because you just get cut from the rocks.\"  Then a big whale was in the ocean, and then the whole ocean became an aquarium.  Then it became a theatre, and Cassie was up on stage singing.  I was the stage manager, and I was sitting with the unicorns, because this was a fantasy play.  I went home and started listening to records.  I realized I didn't have a sing to sing for the talent show the next day, so I panicked and tried to pick out a good song I knew.  The next morning, I got up on stage and decided to sing \"Lean on Me.\"",

         "The Spiral Flight  I walk over near a line of people to get on a plane. My classmate from Brimson Anthony Holden is there. There are some people already in line for the flight. I try to find the right place to stand, because the line seems to branch off into two lines. I choose one of the lines and stand in the metal corral-like line. I'm then the first person in line. A woman calls out for anyone who is flying to Reinhorse, which I know is in Germany, to come to the front of the line. Several men walk by me and descend a staircase to talk to the woman. I hear the woman ask if any of them are willing to change flights, because the flight they're on is really full. The woman says they don't have to change, because they do all have a seat on the flight, but if they did change they would receive compensation. While they talk, we all start to move, and I realize we're going onto a plane flying to Los Angeles. We take off and immediately make a hard right turn. The plane keeps rolling, and we fly in a spiral, spinning like a top as we fly forward. One of the engines is out, and that is causing the spiral. The stewardess says the passengers need to pound on the inside of the walls to get the engine to start, as if it is just stuck. The emergency exit on the plane is open. The engine doesn't start. We spin and fly. People are yelling. I sit next to several men, including my housemate Stephen Ramos. I yell and laugh. We are in a pretty good mood considering we're probably going to die. I joke about how our plane crashing could make a great Fox television special, like \"World's Worse Plane Crashes\". We don't gain altitude, and must land. There is a train below us entering a train yard. If we could land on top of the fast train, we wouldn't crash, and the train could just slow down. We seem to be going in for a landing at the train yard. Then our plane is on the snow-covered ground on a street, sliding, not very fast. I think that since we're in the nose of the plane if the plane slides into the house at the end of the road we could get hurt. The plane stops on the road. I get out of the plane and talk to Stephen. I tell him this whole episode has been so amazing that I must be dreaming. I say this very nonchalantly. I turn and look back and the plane isn't there: I am dreaming! The street is empty: without any people or a plane.",

         "Snowblower Thieves  I'm sitting on a ledge of a wall or building in downtown Wilmerton. The ledge overlooks the main parking lot next to the movie theatre, with Perkins on my left side. The ledge is about 20-30 feet off the ground. The parking lot is empty and the sun is rising. A teacher is on my left, and my brother Wally and another man are on my right. Two men come out of a first floor door of some apartments and jump down to the ground unscathed! I'm amazed at this, because it is a 25-foot drop, and neither man so much as flinches. They immediately rush into a store with guns to rob it. They may have ski masks on. One of the robbers brings a man out of the store at gunpoint. The robber then goes back into the store. The man from the store has an Oozy machine gun that he holds behind his back. The robber emerges from the sore and goes towards the man. The robber takes the man's gun. The second robber brings two young women out of the store. Each woman is pushing a snowblower. The snowblowers are being stolen. The snowblowers are put into the bed of a small gray truck and the two women and the man are put in the passenger seat: all three are taken captive. One of the robbers gets in the truck and speeds over towards us to pick up the other robber. He skids to a stop very close to us and the second robber gets in the truck. Those I am with and I have guns. I have a huge black M-16 assault rifle. It's a mammoth gun and could really do some damage. The truck has stopped right around the corner of the building ledge we're sitting on. I whirl around and aim my rifle at the driver's seat where the two robbers are sitting, as they drive away. I'm shaky with the gun: I've never worked it before, and it's all I can handle. I don't fire any shots, and the truck pulls away. One of the men I'm with thinks I pointed the gun at his head when I spun around and took aim. I thought the safety of the gun was off, and it was ready to fire, but I see now it was on the whole time. I'm in a truck. I have two arrows stuck in my left forearm. I pull them out. A third arrow has been shot in my arm, and I pull it out too. I bleed a very small bit, and the wound on the surface is small. I'm on a big swing with others. I still have my gun. I lose my shoe: it lies on the ground. I try to pick it up when we swing over it. We are done swinging then. I have books of matches that I keep in my socks.",

He had some relations living with him at the time, but it seems as if one of them died. He was about a 75-year-old man. I found myself, plus a few other people, were going on a trip, but before we went, my mother wanted me to go over and ask my grandfather about the feasibility of our family going to Africa. We were in a 1955 Plymouth. So we went over there and I was appointed to ask him. When I first got in, he was busy talking with a doctor. The doctor, I guess, was just giving him a little examination and also talking about the glories of Africa. It also seems that the doctor was something like a vacuum cleaner salesman, but that's a little foggy, and I can't quite remember it. When the doctor finally got through talking to my grandfather, I asked him about Africa and taking my parents. He said a very emphatic no. He said my mother cold never live there. He said there were too many snakes. He said that you live net to a big zoo because they had caged animals, but he said the only way you could live down there was to shoot and kill the food, and he didn't think my mother would ever get along. I went back to the car. It seems as if my mother had gone on to a camp we were staying at and the car had come back and it had 2 other guys and myself so that there were 3 in all, but we drove a ways and then we came to a large zoo, just like the one my grandfather described in Africa. It almost seems as if we were in Africa. We looked around there for a while, and then there were 3 African people who came up to the car and wondered if we were going back to camp. We said we were, so they asked for a ride. The car started back for camp, and I remember we were all rather tired as it had been a long trip. The guys said to stop at the next bar and get a drink. I was a little worried because I knew my mother wouldn't like it if she smelled it, and also we had one guy that I was sure was under 21. Now for this scene it seemed to be sort of in the United States because there were tobacco fields and the billboards were in English.

In this waiting room I had been searching for this pair of plastic fold-up glassed that they give you at the eye doctor. They were in an envelope in the bathroom. I was real excited to find them; that I went to tell the teachers at the grammar school that I had found just what I'd wanted. There were plastic and paper fold-up glasses. There was a lady with real glasses, but she had somebody else's glasses on (not her prescription). I was skipping school that day. I was trying not to get found out. I was trying to come up with a plan to leave. There was a typewriter there and I was trying to just type as fast as I could, and just hit any keys. The stuff came out on the page, \"x j l k , x j l k , x j l k , . \" But the letters were not in straight lines. They went up and down and up and down, in a sort of 'Navajo-ish' pattern on the page. I didn't say anything. I tried to type out some words. The patterns were nice. There were no vowels. I tried to type in a straight line but I could get no vertical action on the typewriter. It was all horizontal. I thought, \"I'll type up a grocery list.\" But I didn't need to get anything anyway. I had run through the red light where the turn off for the grocery was suppose to be, so I was already past there. The phone in this waiting room office was ringing and it was Stephen and he was angry. He was trying to get in there (in the office door) and he was calling. He said, \"Merri, it's STEPHEN.\" And he hung up the phone. On the way to the grocery store was the gray section, and a wooden shack with a sign on a wooden stick that I loved, and instead there was an Amoco station. The man in the car said, \"There's a grocery store in Albany.\" And I was driving. I said, \"We don't have to go half that far.\"",

         "Man, I screwed myself over. What I did is instead of turning on Alarm #1 that is set for 7:14 so that I can wake up in time to do my thing and wake up and eat my breakfast and get dressed before lab at 9:00 -- our class, I mean, at 9:00 -- I turned on Alarm #2 which is set for 5:17, and it just came on and woke me up and now I'm wide awake and it's 5:30 in the morning, and I don't know if I'm going to go back to sleep or I'm just going to stay up, but now I'm all wired for sound because I'm starting to have thoughts go through my mind about all kinds of stuff, and I'm very bad about just turning my brain off. [laugh] Because my brain is always thinking. Okay, so now that I'm awake at this hour and this goofy dream is fresh in my mind, I'm going to put it on the tape. I dreamt that I had to give Christina a flower arrangement. I guess it was for her graduation or her birthday or something. I didn't really want to because she was being a conceited snob to me. Now Christina usually is okay to us, but I hear that she can be quite a snob, so I guess that's what this is based on. And it was just like three roses and some other flowers, so went over to, it turns out that it's not Christina, it's Jill. And Jill had a thought that she wanted me to hold the g_____ while she taped, and I did that and she thanked me and she was surprised. And, let's see what I remember. Oh, we were sitting in the living room, Mom and I, and we were eating this crazy pudding-like type dessert with Cheerios thrown in it. And Mom said that that was something that Melinda used to do. And I dreamt that that evening Melinda had invited us to go to her house, and Mom and I were going to kind of sneak out the back door and walk over there. [laugh] I don't think we ever made it over there, but she was saying how she was going to give us root beer floats and stuff. And the last scene is that I was on a playground at a school, I think, and there was a boy about 10 or 11 and he wanted me to tell him the difference between a May (?) controller and an arranger model. And about that time I woke up.",

         "I was watching Deadpool but it was different. Morena Baccarin and Ryan Reynolds were still in it though. Baccarin was in this dodgy looking carpark and it was night. She was waiting for Deadpool. She was walking past a car and there were some guys in it. She realised it was an ambush and then Deadpool finally came. He fought with a few guys and dodged some bullets and then they both got into this car. She was in the driver's seat but then it was me. He jumpstarted the car and then was screaming 'drive through the cars!' so I started driving and turned and went down this street. The car was old and very slow, but started to pick up speed. He kept screaming 'just keep going' and she/I drove the car over this cliff but there was a massive drop and down below was the ocean. It went in slow motion and went quite far, until finally crashing into the water. Then it showed a beach resort and the opening of the beach. The water bubbled and then Deadpool came walking out, but he was covered in seaweed and stuff and you couldn't see him at all, he was completely green. He walked into the resort. Then it went back and showed Morena Baccarin coming out of the water and she had a mermaid costume on, which showed her cleavage. I was annoyed that they gave her the 'decorative female' treatment. Whatever had happened to them had made them immortal for some reason. They got cleaned up and there were a lot of close ups of Baccarin smiling and I wondered if her only role in the film was to smile a lot.",

My grade school classmate Misty Ryan is a server for the mass. The priest is Father Vance Brock. At the end of mass Father Vance asks if anyone wants to stay and serve a funeral. A lot of people raise their hands or jump up, because they'll get out of the rest of the day at Carter School if they serve. I hope I don't get called on. Father Vance selects three people, not me. Then he tells the rest of us \"cocksuckers\" to leave. My grade school classmate Gino Teavor is there. I grab his jacket for him. Outside is it icy: very slippery. Others and I go over to Carter School. We haven't eaten lunch yet, and it's early afternoon. My friends Tiny and Matt Combs, and Jeff and Ryan Vaurnet are there. They're going to Jefferson School to have a fish fry for lunch in a trailer home. I haven't eaten since I've been in church, so I ask them if I can go with if they'll have enough fish. They say I can. I go upstairs to the secretary's office where I find a television and a VCR. I unplug them to go past them, and then plug them back in. I walk down the dark upstairs hallway with a light in my hand. The doors to the classrooms aren't closed tightly. I don't know which grade I'm in. I hear faint voice in my sixth grade teacher Sherry Devine's room. I don't want to interrupt the people, so I go to the bathroom. There is a tiger in the bathroom. It is huge and strong but gentle. There is a dog with antlers tied to its head. There are two cats, one of which is nice and the other mean. The mean cat climbs up my leg and scratches me. I grab it by the back of the neck and hold it, like I am choking it. I go out of the bathroom and find my name and coat rack underneath it. I'm near the door, I think, because my teachers have always seen me as being responsible enough to be away from the teacher's coat rack. I put the battery charger on my coat rack.
