They see that I'm very sick, and quickly take me to a car to go to the hospital. (I don't see any of that, the next I know is that I'm lying in the back seat of the car - a sedan - going like gangbusters on a huge freeway. It must be 5 lanes in each direction, lots of cars but not crowded, and all going really fast. I can't see anything else but freeway and blue sky, with a few white clouds. As we barrel along, the road rises, and quickly - soon it changes to steps, which doesn't slow anybody down, and it keeps going up, the incline increasing. Now my line of sight changes to a spot at the side of the freeway (outside of the car), looking across it - and the incline (without the steps) takes a sharp turn up to vertical. The cars are not stopping or even slowing down, and they whoosh straight up. They make it about halfway up on momentum, and then gravity takes over and they fall down. I can see them sort of drop off [rather than sliding down still in contact with the pavement] and fall down way below me.",

It crashes not half a block away (rather as though it fell from a height of a few yards than flying straight into the ground). and I think there might be survivors, and that I should call the police. Before I get the number dialed, I realize I want the fire department instead. I get no ring, try again and find the line is dead. Some people (3? - at least one a woman) are coming toward the house and I understand they are responsible for the dead phone and I should be suspicious of them. I try to leave the house - run into a pregnant girl at the back; she seems to be in some sort of a bad way and has maybe started labor. The woman from the plane comes this way, calls the others to come get the pregnant girl, and I pretend to be asleep or dead. They don't buy it, I guess, and we all go inside. I'm not a prisoner, I don't think, so much as being detained for some reason, and I go to my brother's old room. He moved out of it a couple of years ago but there is furniture still there and I haven't looked around in a long time. [This does not seem to be the family home - I felt like it was rented.] There are a couple of chests of drawers that I realize I could have used downstairs long ago, yet I've been looking for acceptable furniture all this time. Also there are blankets (as well as clothes and shoes - women's shoes - but they aren't important), a lot of blankets, and I badly needed those last winter but didn't realize they were here. Also a very nice shoe rack. The woman comes back to say or do something. [I don't know what, and the dream ended about there, I think.]",

A boy of 10 or 12 is impatiently telling me, \"Mother's asleep\" (I think) - as if I'm not supposed to be doing what I'm doing instead of her or without her knowledge or something. This is in an old rambling house with lots of old furniture and interconnected rooms. Lace doilies on little tables, throw rugs, etc. Some of \"us\" (family? friends?) - there's 3 or 4 of us, I think - are outside and there's a dog on the rampage - didn't we think it was a wolf at first? Anyway it turns out to be a black boxer or bulldog or something and it charges the back door. There's some kind of flap or opening in it that I plug up - I don't know what the people outside are doing but they're okay and they come in shortly. Somebody has rather by accident invited somebody like a neighbor to come over for something on the order of borrowing a cup of sugar. Trouble is this person always has a party with him/her. Kind of a group of hangers-on who just hang around talking and drinking tea and you can't ever get them to go away. For some reason I go to the front door. There are 2 of them in the room at the front, in a couple of chairs each with doilies, and little tables next to them with doilies and little lamps, and I think they're men in fairly formal suits and oblivious to anything around them. I sort of look at them in resignation or bemusement. There's a staircase here. (They don't go upstairs, after all they are just visitors, not a mob.) Outside there is a hutch as for rabbits or something, covered, not particularly nice. Next to it are a couple of little open shelters with no amenities. There is a guinea pig in each place. The sun is shining directly on the two outside and it's hot. The one inside is not particularly comfortable but he's okay. The other two are dehydrating and too weak to move. I come and look at them, feeling sad and sympathetic but no anger - I have the idea the person who set this up isn't there. I'm going to take them in and try to save them but I'm not sure I can. I'm not going to just let them die out here. The reason they're here if because they were replaced by the one inside like their usefulness as displays was used up. I want to come back and take away the other one, and get him out of the nasty cage. I'm sad.",

I am there because I live there or at least it belongs to me and I spend time there, and I am on vacation or something. It's afternoon and I remember how the light looked and my cousin came to see me for a visit, as though to let me in on some news or just for fun. I don't know of anything else that happened, but it did involve him lying around on the floor very much the way I do. Very comfortable and casual and warm - that is, that's the way I was feeling. So there's a Training going on, and the room reminds me a bit of school, like a school auditorium. The light is greenish, daylight, morning. The staff wasn't sitting behind tables but in rows of chairs. It was still early - we were instructed to go up on the stage, and we did, but they weren't quite organized and we were standing there for a while. Very informal and chummy. Later I left for a break and went (home?) somewhere away, not a restaurant, for more time than a dinner break. Pete Townsend was with me and maybe some other people. (He wasn't on the team.) Don't know what was going on there, but when it was time to go back we had an errand to run - stopped at a sort of store on a sort of small-town main street. We were going inside and this guy who was with us burst out at me - I don't know what about - and said he was arresting me and getting a peace bond on me. I was shocked but didn't know what it was about except that he was angry at the effect I was having on the group of people that P.T. was involved with. In any case, he keeps me with him and we may have gone inside and come back out again. The place reminds me rather of a dry-goods store, with rows of waist-high bins, and a counter along the side. On the way out, P.T. takes the guy aside and says something very stern and final-sounding in French. I knew it was French but I don't understand it and that was the reason he was using it, so that I wouldn't be embarrassed or have to hear something I wouldn't want to. The guy said something back in French but shorter. P.T. just looked at him like he was disgusted and all through, and took me outside. We got in the car and were driving back - I was still kind of stunned and found he was talking to me - he was explaining something about the incident, and that he could do without this other guy, who I think had been his friend; but he couldn't do without me. He looked at me and said very firmly, \"I need you\". I was overwhelmed and leaned over to him and he pulled me over for a hug. At some point I was concerned that we weren't going to get back to the Training in time because of stopping for an errand, and I thought there might turn out to be another and another, the way I do it.",

It must be 5 lanes in each direction, lots of cars but not crowded, and all going really fast. I can't see anything else but freeway and blue sky, with a few white clouds. As we barrel along, the road rises, and quickly - soon it changes to steps, which doesn't slow anybody down, and it keeps going up, the incline increasing. Now my line of sight changes to a spot at the side of the freeway (outside of the car), looking across it - and the incline (without the steps) takes a sharp turn up to vertical.

A boy of 10 or 12 is impatiently telling me, \"Mother's asleep\" (I think) - as if I'm not supposed to be doing what I'm doing instead of her or without her knowledge or something. This is in an old rambling house with lots of old furniture and interconnected rooms. Lace doilies on little tables, throw rugs, etc. Some of \"us\" (family? friends?) - there's 3 or 4 of us, I think - are outside and there's a dog on the rampage - didn't we think it was a wolf at first? Anyway it turns out to be a black boxer or bulldog or something and it charges the back door. There's some kind of flap or opening in it that I plug up - I don't know what the people outside are doing but they're okay and they come in shortly. Somebody has rather by accident invited somebody like a neighbor to come over for something on the order of borrowing a cup of sugar. Trouble is this person always has a party with him/her. Kind of a group of hangers-on who just hang around talking and drinking tea and you can't ever get them to go away. For some reason I go to the front door. There are 2 of them in the room at the front, in a couple of chairs each with doilies, and little tables next to them with doilies and little lamps, and I think they're men in fairly formal suits and oblivious to anything around them. I sort of look at them in resignation or bemusement. There's a staircase here. (They don't go upstairs, after all they are just visitors, not a mob.) Outside there is a hutch as for rabbits or something, covered, not particularly nice. Next to it are a couple of little open shelters with no amenities. There is a guinea pig in each place. The sun is shining directly on the two outside and it's hot. The one inside is not particularly comfortable but he's okay. The other two are dehydrating and too weak to move. I come and look at them, feeling sad and sympathetic but no anger - I have the idea the person who set this up isn't there. I'm going to take them in and try to save them but I'm not sure I can. I'm not going to just let them die out here. The reason they're here if because they were replaced by the one inside like their usefulness as displays was used up. I want to come back and take away the other one, and get him out of the nasty cage. I'm sad.",

         "I'm in a room that reminds me of (but definitely isn't) the living room of the house on A Street. I am there because I live there or at least it belongs to me and I spend time there, and I am on vacation or something. It's afternoon and I remember how the light looked and my cousin came to see me for a visit, as though to let me in on some news or just for fun. I don't know of anything else that happened, but it did involve him lying around on the floor very much the way I do. Very comfortable and casual and warm - that is, that's the way I was feeling. So there's a Training going on, and the room reminds me a bit of school, like a school auditorium. The light is greenish, daylight, morning. The staff wasn't sitting behind tables but in rows of chairs. It was still early - we were instructed to go up on the stage, and we did, but they weren't quite organized and we were standing there for a while. Very informal and chummy. Later I left for a break and went (home?) somewhere away, not a restaurant, for more time than a dinner break. Pete Townsend was with me and maybe some other people. (He wasn't on the team.) Don't know what was going on there, but when it was time to go back we had an errand to run - stopped at a sort of store on a sort of small-town main street. We were going inside and this guy who was with us burst out at me - I don't know what about - and said he was arresting me and getting a peace bond on me. I was shocked but didn't know what it was about except that he was angry at the effect I was having on the group of people that P.T. was involved with. In any case, he keeps me with him and we may have gone inside and come back out again. The place reminds me rather of a dry-goods store, with rows of waist-high bins, and a counter along the side. On the way out, P.T. takes the guy aside and says something very stern and final-sounding in French. I knew it was French but I don't understand it and that was the reason he was using it, so that I wouldn't be embarrassed or have to hear something I wouldn't want to. The guy said something back in French but shorter. P.T. just looked at him like he was disgusted and all through, and took me outside. We got in the car and were driving back - I was still kind of stunned and found he was talking to me - he was explaining something about the incident, and that he could do without this other guy, who I think had been his friend; but he couldn't do without me. He looked at me and said very firmly, \"I need you\". I was overwhelmed and leaned over to him and he pulled me over for a hug. At some point I was concerned that we weren't going to get back to the Training in time because of stopping for an errand, and I thought there might turn out to be another and another, the way I do it.",

She was in a cage to go there but came out for it - don't know what happened at (like an auditorium?) but we came back to the van. I put her in the driver's side door and went around to the other. Then I fiddled with the door a long time. It was a double swing door, and I hadn't known about this one inside latch about 2/3 up the door - black switch - that latched the side without a handle by itself. I tried several different things to see what it did, then when I got the whole thing shut up it was real dark inside and everything was real awkward. MB went back in her cage and we started off, but I was having some trouble handling the van. We were going along a dirt road on the grounds of the auditorium, joining a line of cars to get to some place like a campground for another event. We weren't gonna stay but I wanted to do something there. We were behind a guy with dark hair and a blonde older woman in a convertible and the guy first looks startled, then nervous, then annoyed at the van. Keeps looking around at us and I wondered what I was doing wrong. I figured I was driving the van backwards at first and looked out for a place I could turn around, but then I realized I wasn't backward, but I was on the passenger side driving with an auxiliary steering wheel. Would've been difficult to change but I figured I was managing all right anyway, so I went on. When we were entering the campground, something happened to the guy in front of us. He's now in a hole in the middle of the road, like up to his shoulders, and he's bitching at a rabbit, who's come up to look at him. He has to duck down for cars to go over the road, rabbit runs off, we go to a place where the road circles around at its end and people have parked. Bit of a hill it's on. Concrete or stone toilet-building like they have in parks. I swing the van around this tight little circle looking for an empty space and there really isn't one, but the swinging around is something of a challenge and apparently it made an impression because some people clapped. I did stop the van in a place that I figured I couldn't leave it but I just wanted to ask somebody the price of cattle.

We drop some when he's handing them to me and I stoop to help pick them up. I'm a bit annoyed that he expects me to do this. We are next to another person but I don't know who. I continue to a house or apartment where there are some people waiting for me, we're preparing for something and there's a task to be performed right now. My mother is there, I think, or somebody I feel that way about - maybe 3 couples and an extra man, who's friendly and pats me on the butt, which I hate and almost yell at him but not quite and I say to myself next time I will. I think the others know and they think he's a creep too. When I realize what we've got to do I'm very disappointed because I was expecting to get dinner - I haven't had much to eat all day - my mind flashes back to one of my male cousins skimpy breakfasts*, and I haven't had anything to speak of since. I am really let down and whiny. [Dream ends there, I think - but I also think it didn't begin there, there was more before.]",

There's a large \"file\"-thing with shelves that rotate individually along the lines of the one at work but on a horizontal axis instead of vertical.

Also apprehensive that they'd get broken from being jostled. When I get home I come into a perhaps duplex - it sort of tends to be the left side, or at least the front door is on the far left - anyway, it's a small living room furnished sort of college-student. I take the figures out and look for a place to put them, but just decide to put them with the others, on a very high shelf above the door - some are Christmas things, and I'm figuring you won't be seeing them all the time anyway, that's as good a way to store them as any. One of them, as I take it out and put it on the floor, is broken after all, but I'm not upset, I can glue it - I don't recognize what it's meant to be, it's a sort of wreath base with little wineglass-shapes that stand up on it. It's one of the wineglasses that's broken, but except for a sliver it'll go back together.

Somebody I know is with the robbers, maybe helping them voluntarily, I'm not sure - but I figure he can tell where I'll go so I have to outwit him. I run down a hall and pass where I would go, down to a room with a lot of painter's and plastering stuff in it. I stash the money under a pile of cloths on the floor, next to a cabinet or something which is just inside left of the door. Back outside and down to the other door where I hope they'll see me just going in - then I think no, I may as well hide if I have a chance. I go further in (it's open and leads into other rooms as if, in a house, you've got living rooms that lead into dining rooms but big open passages rather than doorways? - best I can do - hold the image) and there are 2 people, Cynthia and another woman, who must also be blind because she doesn't react to me. Neither does, they must not hear me either and they're both motionless. I don't look for any good place to hide because the robbers are coming in - I duck as close to this inner wall as I can, hoping they won't come this way - but my right arm sticks out sideways at an angle and I can't get it down. If I move it fast they'll see me move it and I can't seem to inch it gradually. (I think Cynthia leaves in here somewhere.) So one of the men sees me and comes over, but he's not the one to interrogate me, he's an underling, so he's just going to let them know I'm here. He says \"Stand here\" and turns back to the others, moving away from me. I look around, see another room and duck into it quietly. It's green and a lot like the junky old office in the basement of the old building - no one's redecorated here in a hundred years. At first I think it's a lost cause but by George it's got a door on the other side. I thought it might lead to the hall but it doesn't - I don't know where it leads but one way or another I get into an office, where there are rows of people (like there used to be) with adding machines and typewriters - men and women - and I know I'm n home free.

I think they're kind of cute but say they shouldn't be out like that, they'll get hurt, and put them back. Then Momma starts to growl a bit of warning, she hadn't been visible before, but now she comes forward as if she's been crouching at the back of the drain (as if it were a litter cave). I say hi to her and go on. Where I am is rather like a cul-de-sac or circle. We've come from a street, and behind some building, maybe apartments, the road runs by the back and turns round into a fair-sized short underpass, which is where the puppies are. I'm aiming to continue that way.",

         "I'm in a car with Dan, William Shatner, and somebody else - Shatner's driving. We're all talking and there's a car coming the other way rather badly, and I turn around to watch it. Sure enough, it hits another car head-on and I watch carefully because it's the first wreck I've ever actually seen in person. I remark this to the others, but when I turn around again there's nothing to see, both cars still drive and they're going round a corner to deal with the insurance, etc. Meanwhile there's a parked car in our lane and I remind Shatner of it, I don't think he's paying attention. He says it's ok. We get where we're going, but I don't know if it's a house or what. Later I'm at a party. Seems to be a costume party, and I've got on something rather elegant. I'm milling around looking for somebody to talk to, and I know a lot of these people but I don't feel comfortable and mostly I just greet them and let them go on and look for somebody who I'm sure wants to be with me. Eventually I go up some stairs, wide and curving - this is a posh place - and come into a long wide hallway or lobby rather like the ones in hotels outside the ballrooms, with couches and coffee tables. Some other people are there. One of them (but not noticeably Bonnie) knows I've been having trouble with my neck; I think she thinks it's my back. She wants me to try to bend backwards the way we did the other night for a stretch, and I don't want to really try it. Partly it's because I don't want to appear weak, partly because I don't want to find I can do it and be seen to be all right after all - which is partly because I'll be thought of as faking it. Dan and Lynn and Jane and Ken appear and I think, they will help me out here - maybe I can join them now and get away from these people's attention - they know I s____ (I can't describe what I think except that I think of their presence as rescue from the situation.) Later I step (duck?) into a bathroom that's fortuitously unoccupied (this place has been busy) and poke around some. The light's very dim, I don't look for a switch. It's longer than usual, quite fancy, shower stall, and something's interesting that's left of the door. Don't know what it is that I'm wanting to see closer, but I step in and find the floor all squishy. It's been leaking again, bad. This (thing - closet? shower stall? other mechanism?) has been repaired, big-time, and I think it's looking pretty shabby - I'm thinking of Mary Tod, this is her place, and classy people like her aren't supposed to have leaky bathrooms. I wonder if I should back out in case it wants to fall on my head, but I want a closer look at something inside and step in.",

It looks rustic - landlord leads us round to our entrance and inside, where there's an intricate stair arrangement - I think of England, where there can be found these very shallow steps that turn and twist but there's even more here - you don't actually need to take them, you can leap several. We go up that way, rather than following the line back and forth. Also I'm on a bus going to a shopping center. Lots of people on, and I'm sitting all the way in the back. I get a phone call. I'm not surprised that there's a phone, but I think it's rather a disturbance and didn't expect them to actually have me take the call here. It's a girl who also works for the City and I don't really understand what she wants but she obviously thinks I'm in the office and is a little bit annoyed to find that I'm not. Also perplexed - we don't know each other and there's some doubt that she's even got the right number. The bus arrives at the shopping center and there's an Army-recruit thing going on in the parking lot.

Lace doilies on little tables, throw rugs, etc. Some of \"us\" (family? friends?) - there's 3 or 4 of us, I think - are outside and there's a dog on the rampage - didn't we think it was a wolf at first? Anyway it turns out to be a black boxer or bulldog or something and it charges the back door. There's some kind of flap or opening in it that I plug up - I don't know what the people outside are doing but they're okay and they come in shortly. Somebody has rather by accident invited somebody like a neighbor to come over for something on the order of borrowing a cup of sugar. Trouble is this person always has a party with him/her. Kind of a group of hangers-on who just hang around talking and drinking tea and you can't ever get them to go away. For some reason I go to the front door. There are 2 of them in the room at the front, in a couple of chairs each with doilies, and little tables next to them with doilies and little lamps, and I think they're men in fairly formal suits and oblivious to anything around them. I sort of look at them in resignation or bemusement. There's a staircase here. (They don't go upstairs, after all they are just visitors, not a mob.) Outside there is a hutch as for rabbits or something, covered, not particularly nice. Next to it are a couple of little open shelters with no amenities. There is a guinea pig in each place. The sun is shining directly on the two outside and it's hot. The one inside is not particularly comfortable but he's okay. The other two are dehydrating and too weak to move. I come and look at them, feeling sad and sympathetic but no anger - I have the idea the person who set this up isn't there. I'm going to take them in and try to save them but I'm not sure I can. I'm not going to just let them die out here. The reason they're here if because they were replaced by the one inside like their usefulness as displays was used up. I want to come back and take away the other one, and get him out of the nasty cage. I'm sad.",

         "I'm in a room that reminds me of (but definitely isn't) the living room of the house on A Street. I am there because I live there or at least it belongs to me and I spend time there, and I am on vacation or something. It's afternoon and I remember how the light looked and my cousin came to see me for a visit, as though to let me in on some news or just for fun. I don't know of anything else that happened, but it did involve him lying around on the floor very much the way I do. Very comfortable and casual and warm - that is, that's the way I was feeling. So there's a Training going on, and the room reminds me a bit of school, like a school auditorium. The light is greenish, daylight, morning. The staff wasn't sitting behind tables but in rows of chairs. It was still early - we were instructed to go up on the stage, and we did, but they weren't quite organized and we were standing there for a while. Very informal and chummy. Later I left for a break and went (home?) somewhere away, not a restaurant, for more time than a dinner break. Pete Townsend was with me and maybe some other people. (He wasn't on the team.) Don't know what was going on there, but when it was time to go back we had an errand to run - stopped at a sort of store on a sort of small-town main street. We were going inside and this guy who was with us burst out at me - I don't know what about - and said he was arresting me and getting a peace bond on me. I was shocked but didn't know what it was about except that he was angry at the effect I was having on the group of people that P.T. was involved with. In any case, he keeps me with him and we may have gone inside and come back out again. The place reminds me rather of a dry-goods store, with rows of waist-high bins, and a counter along the side. On the way out, P.T. takes the guy aside and says something very stern and final-sounding in French. I knew it was French but I don't understand it and that was the reason he was using it, so that I wouldn't be embarrassed or have to hear something I wouldn't want to. The guy said something back in French but shorter. P.T. just looked at him like he was disgusted and all through, and took me outside. We got in the car and were driving back - I was still kind of stunned and found he was talking to me - he was explaining something about the incident, and that he could do without this other guy, who I think had been his friend; but he couldn't do without me. He looked at me and said very firmly, \"I need you\". I was overwhelmed and leaned over to him and he pulled me over for a hug. At some point I was concerned that we weren't going to get back to the Training in time because of stopping for an errand, and I thought there might turn out to be another and another, the way I do it.",

She was in a cage to go there but came out for it - don't know what happened at (like an auditorium?) but we came back to the van. I put her in the driver's side door and went around to the other. Then I fiddled with the door a long time. It was a double swing door, and I hadn't known about this one inside latch about 2/3 up the door - black switch - that latched the side without a handle by itself. I tried several different things to see what it did, then when I got the whole thing shut up it was real dark inside and everything was real awkward. MB went back in her cage and we started off, but I was having some trouble handling the van. We were going along a dirt road on the grounds of the auditorium, joining a line of cars to get to some place like a campground for another event. We weren't gonna stay but I wanted to do something there. We were behind a guy with dark hair and a blonde older woman in a convertible and the guy first looks startled, then nervous, then annoyed at the van. Keeps looking around at us and I wondered what I was doing wrong. I figured I was driving the van backwards at first and looked out for a place I could turn around, but then I realized I wasn't backward, but I was on the passenger side driving with an auxiliary steering wheel. Would've been difficult to change but I figured I was managing all right anyway, so I went on. When we were entering the campground, something happened to the guy in front of us. He's now in a hole in the middle of the road, like up to his shoulders, and he's bitching at a rabbit, who's come up to look at him. He has to duck down for cars to go over the road, rabbit runs off, we go to a place where the road circles around at its end and people have parked. Bit of a hill it's on. Concrete or stone toilet-building like they have in parks. I swing the van around this tight little circle looking for an empty space and there really isn't one, but the swinging around is something of a challenge and apparently it made an impression because some people clapped. I did stop the van in a place that I figured I couldn't leave it but I just wanted to ask somebody the price of cattle.

Ironically, the door starts to close - slides sideways. The person doing it peeks in for a second. I recognize him (somebody from TV). I jump up to let him know I'm there and make excuse that I just stepped in to wipe dust off me or something. He lets me out and I sheepishly go on. At the end of the street there's sort of a shopping center with a Sanger's and I remember the bra sale. I run into Bill Wilding, who's waiting for me and asks me to take something with me to hand over to somebody I'm going to see. It's a bunch of what looks like hairpins, only not black. We drop some when he's handing them to me and I stoop to help pick them up. I'm a bit annoyed that he expects me to do this. We are next to another person but I don't know who. I continue to a house or apartment where there are some people waiting for me, we're preparing for something and there's a task to be performed right now. My mother is there, I think, or somebody I feel that way about - maybe 3 couples and an extra man, who's friendly and pats me on the butt, which I hate and almost yell at him but not quite and I say to myself next time I will. I think the others know and they think he's a creep too. When I realize what we've got to do I'm very disappointed because I was expecting to get dinner - I haven't had much to eat all day - my mind flashes back to one of my male cousins skimpy breakfasts*, and I haven't had anything to speak of since.

There's a large \"file\"-thing with shelves that rotate individually along the lines of the one at work but on a horizontal axis instead of vertical.

Also apprehensive that they'd get broken from being jostled. When I get home I come into a perhaps duplex - it sort of tends to be the left side, or at least the front door is on the far left - anyway, it's a small living room furnished sort of college-student. I take the figures out and look for a place to put them, but just decide to put them with the others, on a very high shelf above the door - some are Christmas things, and I'm figuring you won't be seeing them all the time anyway, that's as good a way to store them as any. One of them, as I take it out and put it on the floor, is broken after all, but I'm not upset, I can glue it - I don't recognize what it's meant to be, it's a sort of wreath base with little wineglass-shapes that stand up on it. It's one of the wineglasses that's broken, but except for a sliver it'll go back together.

Involves short flights of stairs and heavy doors that won't stay open. I'm with a female (black?) and a male. Back inside, somehow I get an opportunity to thwart the thieves - I get hold of at least some major part of the money and run with it. Somebody I know is with the robbers, maybe helping them voluntarily, I'm not sure - but I figure he can tell where I'll go so I have to outwit him. I run down a hall and pass where I would go, down to a room with a lot of painter's and plastering stuff in it. I stash the money under a pile of cloths on the floor, next to a cabinet or something which is just inside left of the door. Back outside and down to the other door where I hope they'll see me just going in - then I think no, I may as well hide if I have a chance. I go further in (it's open and leads into other rooms as if, in a house, you've got living rooms that lead into dining rooms but big open passages rather than doorways? - best I can do - hold the image) and there are 2 people, Cynthia and another woman, who must also be blind because she doesn't react to me. Neither does, they must not hear me either and they're both motionless. I don't look for any good place to hide because the robbers are coming in - I duck as close to this inner wall as I can, hoping they won't come this way - but my right arm sticks out sideways at an angle and I can't get it down. If I move it fast they'll see me move it and I can't seem to inch it gradually. (I think Cynthia leaves in here somewhere.) So one of the men sees me and comes over, but he's not the one to interrogate me, he's an underling, so he's just going to let them know I'm here. He says \"Stand here\" and turns back to the others, moving away from me. I look around, see another room and duck into it quietly. It's green and a lot like the junky old office in the basement of the old building - no one's redecorated here in a hundred years. At first I think it's a lost cause but by George it's got a door on the other side. I thought it might lead to the hall but it doesn't - I don't know where it leads but one way or another I get into an office, where there are rows of people (like there used to be) with adding machines and typewriters - men and women - and I know I'm n home free. What I want is to get to the police on the ground floor, but I'm afraid of getting caught before I reach them. I keep running. When I wake up I'm still worried I'm not going to make it - sense of desperation.",

I think they're kind of cute but say they shouldn't be out like that, they'll get hurt, and put them back. Then Momma starts to growl a bit of warning, she hadn't been visible before, but now she comes forward as if she's been crouching at the back of the drain (as if it were a litter cave). I say hi to her and go on. Where I am is rather like a cul-de-sac or circle. We've come from a street, and behind some building, maybe apartments, the road runs by the back and turns round into a fair-sized short underpass, which is where the puppies are. I'm aiming to continue that way.",

Sure enough, it hits another car head-on and I watch carefully because it's the first wreck I've ever actually seen in person. I remark this to the others, but when I turn around again there's nothing to see, both cars still drive and they're going round a corner to deal with the insurance, etc. Meanwhile there's a parked car in our lane and I remind Shatner of it, I don't think he's paying attention. He says it's ok. We get where we're going, but I don't know if it's a house or what. Later I'm at a party. Seems to be a costume party, and I've got on something rather elegant. I'm milling around looking for somebody to talk to, and I know a lot of these people but I don't feel comfortable and mostly I just greet them and let them go on and look for somebody who I'm sure wants to be with me. Eventually I go up some stairs, wide and curving - this is a posh place - and come into a long wide hallway or lobby rather like the ones in hotels outside the ballrooms, with couches and coffee tables. Some other people are there. One of them (but not noticeably Bonnie) knows I've been having trouble with my neck; I think she thinks it's my back. She wants me to try to bend backwards the way we did the other night for a stretch, and I don't want to really try it. Partly it's because I don't want to appear weak, partly because I don't want to find I can do it and be seen to be all right after all - which is partly because I'll be thought of as faking it. Dan and Lynn and Jane and Ken appear and I think, they will help me out here - maybe I can join them now and get away from these people's attention - they know I s____ (I can't describe what I think except that I think of their presence as rescue from the situation.) Later I step (duck?) into a bathroom that's fortuitously unoccupied (this place has been busy) and poke around some. The light's very dim, I don't look for a switch. It's longer than usual, quite fancy, shower stall, and something's interesting that's left of the door. Don't know what it is that I'm wanting to see closer, but I step in and find the floor all squishy. It's been leaking again, bad. This (thing - closet? shower stall? other mechanism?) has been repaired, big-time, and I think it's looking pretty shabby - I'm thinking of Mary Tod, this is her place, and classy people like her aren't supposed to have leaky bathrooms. I wonder if I should back out in case it wants to fall on my head, but I want a closer look at something inside and step in.",

It looks rustic - landlord leads us round to our entrance and inside, where there's an intricate stair arrangement - I think of England, where there can be found these very shallow steps that turn and twist but there's even more here - you don't actually need to take them, you can leap several. We go up that way, rather than following the line back and forth. Also I'm on a bus going to a shopping center. Lots of people on, and I'm sitting all the way in the back. I get a phone call. I'm not surprised that there's a phone, but I think it's rather a disturbance and didn't expect them to actually have me take the call here. It's a girl who also works for the City and I don't really understand what she wants but she obviously thinks I'm in the office and is a little bit annoyed to find that I'm not. Also perplexed - we don't know each other and there's some doubt that she's even got the right number. The bus arrives at the shopping center and there's an Army-recruit thing going on in the parking lot.

[This does not seem to be the family home - I felt like it was rented.] There are a couple of chests of drawers that I realize I could have used downstairs long ago, yet I've been looking for acceptable furniture all this time. Also there are blankets (as well as clothes and shoes - women's shoes - but they aren't important), a lot of blankets, and I badly needed those last winter but didn't realize they were here. Also a very nice shoe rack. The woman comes back to say or do something. [I don't know what, and the dream ended about there, I think.]",

A boy of 10 or 12 is impatiently telling me, \"Mother's asleep\" (I think) - as if I'm not supposed to be doing what I'm doing instead of her or without her knowledge or something. This is in an old rambling house with lots of old furniture and interconnected rooms. Lace doilies on little tables, throw rugs, etc. Some of \"us\" (family? friends?) - there's 3 or 4 of us, I think - are outside and there's a dog on the rampage - didn't we think it was a wolf at first? Anyway it turns out to be a black boxer or bulldog or something and it charges the back door. There's some kind of flap or opening in it that I plug up - I don't know what the people outside are doing but they're okay and they come in shortly. Somebody has rather by accident invited somebody like a neighbor to come over for something on the order of borrowing a cup of sugar. Trouble is this person always has a party with him/her. Kind of a group of hangers-on who just hang around talking and drinking tea and you can't ever get them to go away. For some reason I go to the front door. There are 2 of them in the room at the front, in a couple of chairs each with doilies, and little tables next to them with doilies and little lamps, and I think they're men in fairly formal suits and oblivious to anything around them. I sort of look at them in resignation or bemusement. There's a staircase here. (They don't go upstairs, after all they are just visitors, not a mob.) Outside there is a hutch as for rabbits or something, covered, not particularly nice. Next to it are a couple of little open shelters with no amenities. There is a guinea pig in each place. The sun is shining directly on the two outside and it's hot. The one inside is not particularly comfortable but he's okay. The other two are dehydrating and too weak to move. I come and look at them, feeling sad and sympathetic but no anger - I have the idea the person who set this up isn't there. I'm going to take them in and try to save them but I'm not sure I can. I'm not going to just let them die out here. The reason they're here if because they were replaced by the one inside like their usefulness as displays was used up. I want to come back and take away the other one, and get him out of the nasty cage. I'm sad.",

I am there because I live there or at least it belongs to me and I spend time there, and I am on vacation or something. It's afternoon and I remember how the light looked and my cousin came to see me for a visit, as though to let me in on some news or just for fun. I don't know of anything else that happened, but it did involve him lying around on the floor very much the way I do. Very comfortable and casual and warm - that is, that's the way I was feeling. So there's a Training going on, and the room reminds me a bit of school, like a school auditorium. The light is greenish, daylight, morning. The staff wasn't sitting behind tables but in rows of chairs. It was still early - we were instructed to go up on the stage, and we did, but they weren't quite organized and we were standing there for a while. Very informal and chummy. Later I left for a break and went (home?) somewhere away, not a restaurant, for more time than a dinner break. Pete Townsend was with me and maybe some other people. (He wasn't on the team.) Don't know what was going on there, but when it was time to go back we had an errand to run - stopped at a sort of store on a sort of small-town main street. We were going inside and this guy who was with us burst out at me - I don't know what about - and said he was arresting me and getting a peace bond on me. I was shocked but didn't know what it was about except that he was angry at the effect I was having on the group of people that P.T. was involved with. In any case, he keeps me with him and we may have gone inside and come back out again. The place reminds me rather of a dry-goods store, with rows of waist-high bins, and a counter along the side. On the way out, P.T. takes the guy aside and says something very stern and final-sounding in French. I knew it was French but I don't understand it and that was the reason he was using it, so that I wouldn't be embarrassed or have to hear something I wouldn't want to. The guy said something back in French but shorter. P.T. just looked at him like he was disgusted and all through, and took me outside. We got in the car and were driving back - I was still kind of stunned and found he was talking to me - he was explaining something about the incident, and that he could do without this other guy, who I think had been his friend; but he couldn't do without me. He looked at me and said very firmly, \"I need you\". I was overwhelmed and leaned over to him and he pulled me over for a hug. At some point I was concerned that we weren't going to get back to the Training in time because of stopping for an errand, and I thought there might turn out to be another and another, the way I do it.",

She was in a cage to go there but came out for it - don't know what happened at (like an auditorium?) but we came back to the van. I put her in the driver's side door and went around to the other. Then I fiddled with the door a long time. It was a double swing door, and I hadn't known about this one inside latch about 2/3 up the door - black switch - that latched the side without a handle by itself. I tried several different things to see what it did, then when I got the whole thing shut up it was real dark inside and everything was real awkward. MB went back in her cage and we started off, but I was having some trouble handling the van. We were going along a dirt road on the grounds of the auditorium, joining a line of cars to get to some place like a campground for another event. We weren't gonna stay but I wanted to do something there. We were behind a guy with dark hair and a blonde older woman in a convertible and the guy first looks startled, then nervous, then annoyed at the van. Keeps looking around at us and I wondered what I was doing wrong. I figured I was driving the van backwards at first and looked out for a place I could turn around, but then I realized I wasn't backward, but I was on the passenger side driving with an auxiliary steering wheel. Would've been difficult to change but I figured I was managing all right anyway, so I went on. When we were entering the campground, something happened to the guy in front of us. He's now in a hole in the middle of the road, like up to his shoulders, and he's bitching at a rabbit, who's come up to look at him. He has to duck down for cars to go over the road, rabbit runs off, we go to a place where the road circles around at its end and people have parked. Bit of a hill it's on. Concrete or stone toilet-building like they have in parks. I swing the van around this tight little circle looking for an empty space and there really isn't one, but the swinging around is something of a challenge and apparently it made an impression because some people clapped. I did stop the van in a place that I figured I couldn't leave it but I just wanted to ask somebody the price of cattle.

I daydreamed it was me playing and planning to go for it all when I came awake and saw that My stepmother was nowhere in sight. Dad wasn't concerned, he said she'd probably gone by to see about \"the boys\" - who I took to mean my brother and male cousin, living together as roommates. We cut through somebody's yard and across the corner of a yard and a porch. I knew we were in Oak town and recognized the kind of little semi-shabby house, but kind of envied it and the little apartment house we passed - one window had something hanging in it that I noticed. Wherever the place was, they weren't home, and we went on (I was aware of it being a very long walk) past where Grandmom used to live [which is not in Oak town]. We stopped - for a rest? - next to the house, just where you couldn't see it, facing the railroad track. Dad leaned against (a car?) and talked a little, as if to himself, about how he wished things were different - with him and My stepmother, with the family - and he looked sad and dejected. I started to tell him he could have it different, maybe for both of them, maybe just for him, and almost got to tell him about LT when I woke up - I'd said I was going to a psychotherapist and that was good, but what really made the difference was...",

Ironically, the door starts to close - slides sideways. The person doing it peeks in for a second. I recognize him (somebody from TV). I jump up to let him know I'm there and make excuse that I just stepped in to wipe dust off me or something. He lets me out and I sheepishly go on. At the end of the street there's sort of a shopping center with a Sanger's and I remember the bra sale. I run into Bill Wilding, who's waiting for me and asks me to take something with me to hand over to somebody I'm going to see. It's a bunch of what looks like hairpins, only not black. We drop some when he's handing them to me and I stoop to help pick them up. I'm a bit annoyed that he expects me to do this. We are next to another person but I don't know who. I continue to a house or apartment where there are some people waiting for me, we're preparing for something and there's a task to be performed right now. My mother is there, I think, or somebody I feel that way about - maybe 3 couples and an extra man, who's friendly and pats me on the butt, which I hate and almost yell at him but not quite and I say to myself next time I will. I think the others know and they think he's a creep too. When I realize what we've got to do I'm very disappointed because I was expecting to get dinner - I haven't had much to eat all day - my mind flashes back to one of my male cousins skimpy breakfasts*, and I haven't had anything to speak of since.

One of them, as I take it out and put it on the floor, is broken after all, but I'm not upset, I can glue it - I don't recognize what it's meant to be, it's a sort of wreath base with little wineglass-shapes that stand up on it.

I go further in (it's open and leads into other rooms as if, in a house, you've got living rooms that lead into dining rooms but big open passages rather than doorways? - best I can do - hold the image) and there are 2 people, Cynthia and another woman, who must also be blind because she doesn't react to me. Neither does, they must not hear me either and they're both motionless. I don't look for any good place to hide because the robbers are coming in - I duck as close to this inner wall as I can, hoping they won't come this way - but my right arm sticks out sideways at an angle and I can't get it down. If I move it fast they'll see me move it and I can't seem to inch it gradually. (I think Cynthia leaves in here somewhere.) So one of the men sees me and comes over, but he's not the one to interrogate me, he's an underling, so he's just going to let them know I'm here. He says \"Stand here\" and turns back to the others, moving away from me. I look around, see another room and duck into it quietly. It's green and a lot like the junky old office in the basement of the old building - no one's redecorated here in a hundred years. At first I think it's a lost cause but by George it's got a door on the other side. I thought it might lead to the hall but it doesn't - I don't know where it leads but one way or another I get into an office, where there are rows of people (like there used to be) with adding machines and typewriters - men and women - and I know I'm n home free. What I want is to get to the police on the ground floor, but I'm afraid of getting caught before I reach them. I keep running. When I wake up I'm still worried I'm not going to make it - sense of desperation.",

I think they're kind of cute but say they shouldn't be out like that, they'll get hurt, and put them back. Then Momma starts to growl a bit of warning, she hadn't been visible before, but now she comes forward as if she's been crouching at the back of the drain (as if it were a litter cave). I say hi to her and go on. Where I am is rather like a cul-de-sac or circle. We've come from a street, and behind some building, maybe apartments, the road runs by the back and turns round into a fair-sized short underpass, which is where the puppies are. I'm aiming to continue that way.",

         "I'm in a car with Dan, William Shatner, and somebody else - Shatner's driving. We're all talking and there's a car coming the other way rather badly, and I turn around to watch it. Sure enough, it hits another car head-on and I watch carefully because it's the first wreck I've ever actually seen in person. I remark this to the others, but when I turn around again there's nothing to see, both cars still drive and they're going round a corner to deal with the insurance, etc. Meanwhile there's a parked car in our lane and I remind Shatner of it, I don't think he's paying attention. He says it's ok. We get where we're going, but I don't know if it's a house or what. Later I'm at a party. Seems to be a costume party, and I've got on something rather elegant. I'm milling around looking for somebody to talk to, and I know a lot of these people but I don't feel comfortable and mostly I just greet them and let them go on and look for somebody who I'm sure wants to be with me. Eventually I go up some stairs, wide and curving - this is a posh place - and come into a long wide hallway or lobby rather like the ones in hotels outside the ballrooms, with couches and coffee tables. Some other people are there. One of them (but not noticeably Bonnie) knows I've been having trouble with my neck; I think she thinks it's my back. She wants me to try to bend backwards the way we did the other night for a stretch, and I don't want to really try it. Partly it's because I don't want to appear weak, partly because I don't want to find I can do it and be seen to be all right after all - which is partly because I'll be thought of as faking it. Dan and Lynn and Jane and Ken appear and I think, they will help me out here - maybe I can join them now and get away from these people's attention - they know I s____ (I can't describe what I think except that I think of their presence as rescue from the situation.) Later I step (duck?) into a bathroom that's fortuitously unoccupied (this place has been busy) and poke around some. The light's very dim, I don't look for a switch. It's longer than usual, quite fancy, shower stall, and something's interesting that's left of the door. Don't know what it is that I'm wanting to see closer, but I step in and find the floor all squishy. It's been leaking again, bad. This (thing - closet? shower stall? other mechanism?) has been repaired, big-time, and I think it's looking pretty shabby - I'm thinking of Mary Tod, this is her place, and classy people like her aren't supposed to have leaky bathrooms. I wonder if I should back out in case it wants to fall on my head, but I want a closer look at something inside and step in.",

We go along to another place where the landlord is more generous and frankly this place is nicer and in better condition than the last anyway. It looks rustic - landlord leads us round to our entrance and inside, where there's an intricate stair arrangement - I think of England, where there can be found these very shallow steps that turn and twist but there's even more here - you don't actually need to take them, you can leap several. We go up that way, rather than following the line back and forth. Also I'm on a bus going to a shopping center. Lots of people on, and I'm sitting all the way in the back. I get a phone call. I'm not surprised that there's a phone, but I think it's rather a disturbance and didn't expect them to actually have me take the call here. It's a girl who also works for the City and I don't really understand what she wants but she obviously thinks I'm in the office and is a little bit annoyed to find that I'm not. Also perplexed - we don't know each other and there's some doubt that she's even got the right number. The bus arrives at the shopping center and there's an Army-recruit thing going on in the parking lot. Turns out there's a lot of new recruits on this bus and they're meant to get off and join their group, so we have to wait a bit while that gets organized.

         "I'm at a family reunion in a large fine house with grounds (or a maybe a rented public building like in a park) - maybe it's granite or something, very imposing. I'm on a little round balcony with a few others (I think men), there are lots more people inside. I feel faint and collapse. They see that I'm very sick, and quickly take me to a car to go to the hospital. (I don't see any of that, the next I know is that I'm lying in the back seat of the car - a sedan - going like gangbusters on a huge freeway. It must be 5 lanes in each direction, lots of cars but not crowded, and all going really fast. I can't see anything else but freeway and blue sky, with a few white clouds. As we barrel along, the road rises, and quickly - soon it changes to steps, which doesn't slow anybody down, and it keeps going up, the incline increasing. Now my line of sight changes to a spot at the side of the freeway (outside of the car), looking across it - and the incline (without the steps) takes a sharp turn up to vertical. The cars are not stopping or even slowing down, and they whoosh straight up. They make it about halfway up on momentum, and then gravity takes over and they fall down. I can see them sort of drop off [rather than sliding down still in contact with the pavement] and fall down way below me.",

It crashes not half a block away (rather as though it fell from a height of a few yards than flying straight into the ground). and I think there might be survivors, and that I should call the police. Before I get the number dialed, I realize I want the fire department instead. I get no ring, try again and find the line is dead. Some people (3? - at least one a woman) are coming toward the house and I understand they are responsible for the dead phone and I should be suspicious of them. I try to leave the house - run into a pregnant girl at the back; she seems to be in some sort of a bad way and has maybe started labor. The woman from the plane comes this way, calls the others to come get the pregnant girl, and I pretend to be asleep or dead. They don't buy it, I guess, and we all go inside.

A boy of 10 or 12 is impatiently telling me, \"Mother's asleep\" (I think) - as if I'm not supposed to be doing what I'm doing instead of her or without her knowledge or something. This is in an old rambling house with lots of old furniture and interconnected rooms. Lace doilies on little tables, throw rugs, etc. Some of \"us\" (family? friends?) - there's 3 or 4 of us, I think - are outside and there's a dog on the rampage - didn't we think it was a wolf at first? Anyway it turns out to be a black boxer or bulldog or something and it charges the back door. There's some kind of flap or opening in it that I plug up - I don't know what the people outside are doing but they're okay and they come in shortly. Somebody has rather by accident invited somebody like a neighbor to come over for something on the order of borrowing a cup of sugar. Trouble is this person always has a party with him/her. Kind of a group of hangers-on who just hang around talking and drinking tea and you can't ever get them to go away. For some reason I go to the front door. There are 2 of them in the room at the front, in a couple of chairs each with doilies, and little tables next to them with doilies and little lamps, and I think they're men in fairly formal suits and oblivious to anything around them. I sort of look at them in resignation or bemusement. There's a staircase here. (They don't go upstairs, after all they are just visitors, not a mob.) Outside there is a hutch as for rabbits or something, covered, not particularly nice. Next to it are a couple of little open shelters with no amenities. There is a guinea pig in each place. The sun is shining directly on the two outside and it's hot. The one inside is not particularly comfortable but he's okay. The other two are dehydrating and too weak to move. I come and look at them, feeling sad and sympathetic but no anger - I have the idea the person who set this up isn't there. I'm going to take them in and try to save them but I'm not sure I can. I'm not going to just let them die out here. The reason they're here if because they were replaced by the one inside like their usefulness as displays was used up.

         "I'm in a room that reminds me of (but definitely isn't) the living room of the house on A Street. I am there because I live there or at least it belongs to me and I spend time there, and I am on vacation or something. It's afternoon and I remember how the light looked and my cousin came to see me for a visit, as though to let me in on some news or just for fun. I don't know of anything else that happened, but it did involve him lying around on the floor very much the way I do. Very comfortable and casual and warm - that is, that's the way I was feeling. So there's a Training going on, and the room reminds me a bit of school, like a school auditorium. The light is greenish, daylight, morning. The staff wasn't sitting behind tables but in rows of chairs. It was still early - we were instructed to go up on the stage, and we did, but they weren't quite organized and we were standing there for a while. Very informal and chummy. Later I left for a break and went (home?) somewhere away, not a restaurant, for more time than a dinner break. Pete Townsend was with me and maybe some other people. (He wasn't on the team.) Don't know what was going on there, but when it was time to go back we had an errand to run - stopped at a sort of store on a sort of small-town main street. We were going inside and this guy who was with us burst out at me - I don't know what about - and said he was arresting me and getting a peace bond on me. I was shocked but didn't know what it was about except that he was angry at the effect I was having on the group of people that P.T. was involved with. In any case, he keeps me with him and we may have gone inside and come back out again. The place reminds me rather of a dry-goods store, with rows of waist-high bins, and a counter along the side. On the way out, P.T. takes the guy aside and says something very stern and final-sounding in French. I knew it was French but I don't understand it and that was the reason he was using it, so that I wouldn't be embarrassed or have to hear something I wouldn't want to. The guy said something back in French but shorter. P.T. just looked at him like he was disgusted and all through, and took me outside. We got in the car and were driving back - I was still kind of stunned and found he was talking to me - he was explaining something about the incident, and that he could do without this other guy, who I think had been his friend; but he couldn't do without me. He looked at me and said very firmly, \"I need you\". I was overwhelmed and leaned over to him and he pulled me over for a hug. At some point I was concerned that we weren't going to get back to the Training in time because of stopping for an errand, and I thought there might turn out to be another and another, the way I do it.",

We were behind a guy with dark hair and a blonde older woman in a convertible and the guy first looks startled, then nervous, then annoyed at the van. Keeps looking around at us and I wondered what I was doing wrong. I figured I was driving the van backwards at first and looked out for a place I could turn around, but then I realized I wasn't backward, but I was on the passenger side driving with an auxiliary steering wheel. Would've been difficult to change but I figured I was managing all right anyway, so I went on. When we were entering the campground, something happened to the guy in front of us. He's now in a hole in the middle of the road, like up to his shoulders, and he's bitching at a rabbit, who's come up to look at him. He has to duck down for cars to go over the road, rabbit runs off, we go to a place where the road circles around at its end and people have parked. Bit of a hill it's on. Concrete or stone toilet-building like they have in parks. I swing the van around this tight little circle looking for an empty space and there really isn't one, but the swinging around is something of a challenge and apparently it made an impression because some people clapped. I did stop the van in a place that I figured I couldn't leave it but I just wanted to ask somebody the price of cattle. Somebody told me $31 a head and I wanted to explain that I meant a sort of middle-range rather than the best, or real cheap.",

One of them, as I take it out and put it on the floor, is broken after all, but I'm not upset, I can glue it - I don't recognize what it's meant to be, it's a sort of wreath base with little wineglass-shapes that stand up on it.

She leaves to ask somebody outside the room where I am. Someone else opens a suitcase to check what she's got and leafs through it. As she does I see a yellow blanket that looks like it may be wool and since there's an indication that she may be up for selling this stuff, I check. It is wool, and I ask if she wants to sell this. It turns out to be Sharon Clements. She says maybe, and I ask how much. I also check the label again to be sure it's a double. (I've also been thinking it's a shame it's yellow, I'm not that fond of it, but it'll go with my bedroom well enough.) When I ask, she clouds up a little and doesn't answer. After a bit, she says it's not me, it was just when I asked her and she really thought about selling it, a wave of (sorrow? - it's not my feeling) came over her, and she'd like to go clear. There's somebody here acting as Team Support (though a Training isn't going on right now) and we go across the room where she is.

He is making sense but it isn't his business, and the other girl breaks into his speech, joining in with the words, which disturbs him, and she eventually subdues him, I think - she also turns to me and says adamantly not to interfere (I can't remember the words) and I say I would never dream of it - or it hadn't entered my mind.

Involves short flights of stairs and heavy doors that won't stay open. I'm with a female (black?) and a male. Back inside, somehow I get an opportunity to thwart the thieves - I get hold of at least some major part of the money and run with it. Somebody I know is with the robbers, maybe helping them voluntarily, I'm not sure - but I figure he can tell where I'll go so I have to outwit him. I run down a hall and pass where I would go, down to a room with a lot of painter's and plastering stuff in it. I stash the money under a pile of cloths on the floor, next to a cabinet or something which is just inside left of the door. Back outside and down to the other door where I hope they'll see me just going in - then I think no, I may as well hide if I have a chance. I go further in (it's open and leads into other rooms as if, in a house, you've got living rooms that lead into dining rooms but big open passages rather than doorways? - best I can do - hold the image) and there are 2 people, Cynthia and another woman, who must also be blind because she doesn't react to me. Neither does, they must not hear me either and they're both motionless. I don't look for any good place to hide because the robbers are coming in - I duck as close to this inner wall as I can, hoping they won't come this way - but my right arm sticks out sideways at an angle and I can't get it down. If I move it fast they'll see me move it and I can't seem to inch it gradually. (I think Cynthia leaves in here somewhere.) So one of the men sees me and comes over, but he's not the one to interrogate me, he's an underling, so he's just going to let them know I'm here. He says \"Stand here\" and turns back to the others, moving away from me. I look around, see another room and duck into it quietly. It's green and a lot like the junky old office in the basement of the old building - no one's redecorated here in a hundred years. At first I think it's a lost cause but by George it's got a door on the other side. I thought it might lead to the hall but it doesn't - I don't know where it leads but one way or another I get into an office, where there are rows of people (like there used to be) with adding machines and typewriters - men and women - and I know I'm n home free. What I want is to get to the police on the ground floor, but I'm afraid of getting caught before I reach them. I keep running.

         "I had bought Grandma F's house to save it from being torn down. Part of me is very excited to be there and part of me is very worried about moving back to the country, especially to St. Joe. I think Matthew and I talk about it a little. He has the same mixed feelings. There is so much baggage attached to living there. The house was refurbished/remodeled before we closed on the sale. I was in the kitchen talking to someone from my family about what a great job Marlene F's family had done refurbishing this house. The house was much, much larger in the dream than in waking life. I see something in the bottom drawer of the stove and take it out and sat it on top to the left of the stove. It was very hot. I sat it on the counter and it was bubbling. Marlene F came in and took potholders and checked something in the oven that she had been cooking. She looked at me kind of funny, and the dish I had removed from the drawer. I then realized that it wasn't a drawer that I took that out of. It was part of the stove, a broiler drawer, and the dish still needed to cook more. I explained to Marlene F what I had thought and why I had taken it out then I put it back in the oven/drawer. I had decided to rent some of the rooms to college students. This was going to practically pay my mortgage for me, even though I wasn't going to charge them that much. One of the people that was going to move in there, however, was Jo V. I was so excited that she was moving in, for a number of reasons. She is such a dear friend. She can help me in areas that is not a strength of mine, and it would simply be good to have at least one other person there that I know. There are a bunch of college students outside, standing in a row. I went out to talk to them briefly and tell them we're not quite ready for them to come in yet. I tell them that we are going to allow them to choose their rooms in the order that they registered and pay. They all began reaching for their payments. One Asian couple was going to share a room. They weren't married. They handed me a credit card. One I tried to process it, it was denied. I felt bad for them but needed to only accept students who could pay. Now I began wondering if I would be able to actually cash any checks these students give me. As I continue talk to the group I watch the Asian couple walk away, very dejected and worried. They don't know what they're going to do now. I later decide that I have an extra room and I go back outside looking for them. I see them walking along the road. I run to catch up to them and ask them what they plan to do now. They said they were going to try to get a ride to someplace where they could get some money. I suggested that they at least stay with me for the evening, no charge. I tell them they can help the cook in the morning with breakfast and dishes. I can tell they are very grateful for this so they walk back with me. As we're walking back I think about my intensives at GC. Everyone had to sign up to help in the kitchen for at least one meal during the week that we were there. I decide that it would be a good idea to make helping out a part of the rental agreement for all of the students. There would be assigned tasks and they could sign up for the tasks or shifts that work best for them and their schedules. I let them come inside but tell them they have to wait a bit to get their rooms. Jo V comes in and sits down her luggage. I take her on a tour of the house. We're admiring the nice wall-colors they choose. The upstairs looks very much like the scene of a dream that I had in October 2001. Only where the alcoves were in that dream were doors to the various rooms in this dream. It was almost like a large open lobby, with the doors of the rooms on three walls and the opening from the staircase on the other. I told Jo V I had dreamed about this space before and now here it is. I'm loving that. We walk around and look at the various rooms. The first room we look at only has a curtain for the door. It is the smallest and the most modestly decorated. I thought Jo V would probably take this one and let the students have the other rooms. The other rooms had doors. I was thinking about the small storage crawl space in Grandma's house that we used to hide in as children. I wondered if they had left that and was trying to remember what room it was in. I also remember that a number of the rooms had one or more smaller rooms, or storage areas, inside the individual room. I was trying to remember which room, or rooms, that was. I realized that I had designated that for my own room. It seems to change, sometimes in the dream it seems to be upstairs and at other times downstairs. When they refurbished the house they made the staircase much wider and made all of the steps from a beautiful knotty pine. Towards the bottom of the staircase it made a sharp left-angle turn for the final few steps. Those steps were each longer than the one before it, creating a kind of fan shape. We're talking about needing to finish up the painting. I called an expert and asked their opinion and they told me I should paint the baseboards and crown molding to match the wall colors but leave the door and window trims white. I had gotten a very small thing of paint, about the size of a matchbox except a tad longer. It was the pinkish-red color that was in one room. I had a small artists brush and I began painting one of the baseboards, toward the top so I could immediately see how well it was going to match the wall color. A little later someone came and asked me about it. I said I had put a little on there to see if when it dried it would be close enough to the wall color. I told them what the expert had said. They didn't seem to think that I was going to work, or not going to look good. I'm not sure which. The area now seems to be one long, very narrow hallway with all of the room doorways to my right. I see that the students have gone ahead and chosen their rooms rather than waiting for me. I see one girl lift a curtain and come out of her room. I look toward the ceiling at the curtain and realize that there is just one long curtain hung across the entire wall to act as a door for every room. That meant they had to lift the curtain from the bottom when going in or out of their rooms and risk disturbing those in the other rooms. I didn't think this was at all satisfactory. The house is attached to the children's museum. The alcoves in the October 01 dream were in the back section of a theater, behind the last row of seats. I see a wall with a somewhat hidden entrance. I decide to take Jo V and show her what is back there, acting like I know what it is when I actually don't. There is a woman in there practicing some type of event or performance with a combination of adults and children. I don't know who they are. The woman turns and looks at me and says, sshhh. I realize who she is, who they are, and what they are doing. [Don't know any of them in waking life.] There is another doorway, leading to yet another area behind this one. Again, I pretend to Jo V that I know what it is and take her back there. I realize this is the back stage area for the children's museum. We shared use of this backstage area. I was unclear as to whether I owned the entire building or just the house portion of it. But this means the scene has changed from being a country home in St. Joe to a city home in the city where I live. I lead Jo V back, quietly walking through the area where the group is practicing. I take her to show her another area. There is an entryway that is split. One way leads to my room and the other leads to a huge sewing area. I know she is going to love having this there. The left and front walls are lined from floor to ceiling with various fabrics. The right one or two shelving units are full of decorative trims. Along the right wall something else is displayed, related to crafts or sewing. In the center of the room is a large workstation. There is a woman there. She introduces herself as the staff seamstress. I immediately thought to myself that I cannot afford to have a full-time seamstress and wondered then if I had other full-time staff. She must have noticed a look on my face because she quickly said that I do not pay her salary. That her salary is paid through the sewing projects she does for my tenants. This was a very large and oddly shaped room. John, a male friend of mine is there. [I don't know him in waking life.] I am saying goodbye to him as he is getting ready to leave. He is headed off to do something in particular. It is political and is somehow related to Russia. He gets on a train and leaves. As I walk through the hallway past the room doors I see that there are a lot of young people in each room. I decide a lot of them must be visiting friends, but see that some of them are preparing to sleep on the floor for the night. I decide we need to have an initial house meeting to discuss rules and such, and then we need to have them on a regular basis. I tell them all we are going to have a house meeting in the morning right after breakfast. Some of them moan and roll their eyes. Others look at me like they don't know what I'm talking about and don't understand why we would need this. I tell them it's to let them know the house rules but also to discuss anything they want to discuss. For example, if one of them have allergies to fragrances we should all know that and try to respect it by refraining from using any kinds of fragrances around them. Or if anyone has something that is a real hot-button for them, we should know about it. We just want to get to know each other and try as best we can to respect each other and each other's preferences. It will help us to live together much more harmoniously. I decide that I'll also talk about signing up for tasks during the house meeting. The next morning I go down expecting to see the kitchen staff fixing breakfast. Instead, I see all of the students fixing their own breakfast. One is fixing peanut butter on toast. She has a special name for it, but I can't recall now what it was. I felt bad that they were having to fix their own breakfast, yet certainly didn't want to do it myself. There was very little room to move between the counters and stove and it was not well lit. There were probably fifty students there. I call attention for the house meeting. I realize that I need to get everyone closer together so I can see everyone and so that everyone can hear. I decide we'll go somewhere else in the house and wave my hand asking them to all follow me. The walls are now very curvy. When I get to where I want to have the meeting there is just a large carpeted area. I think it should be fine to ask them to sit on the floor. There is one obese girl there. I see a friend trying to help her sit on the floor. Before I can change my mind she is sitting so I decide to let it go. Many of the students have stopped further down the hall, around one of the curves and I can't see them. I start and decide I need them all closer together so I call those students to come to where we are. I realize there isn't room for everyone there so I walk further and instruct them to continue following me. We reach an area that looks somewhat like the lobby of a nice hotel or a very nice waiting room in a hospital. There are partial-walls every now and then, all curved. Some have sofas and chairs toward the middle of the room, semi-hidden on both sides by these partial-walls. Some have sofas and chairs along the outside of the walls. There are plants and it is very nicely decorated. I stop there and ask the students to find seats. Some will have to sit on the floor but I'm not concerned about that. I think some of them are still too far away but decide to just make the best of it. I had gone to ask the woman in charge of the children's museum if we could just use the auditorium for our meeting. Even though there was nothing going on she didn't want to allow it. I wondered again if I owned the entire building or just the house part of it. I begin talking. I have to talk loudly so they can all hear me. There is a floor to ceiling sheer-fabric curtain hanging along the wall I'm facing. I realize that the backstage area of the children's museum auditorium is on the other side. At first I don't think much of it because there is nothing going on there. As I talk I walk around the area. I look behind the sheers and see there is some kind of meeting or performance going on in the backstage area. I then tell the students they are going to need to move in closer together so I don't have to talk so loud and bother the people on the other side of the curtain. As I am talking I am also standing on some of the tables so the students have a better chance of seeing and hearing me. I occasionally step from one table to another, without stepping on the floor. The wall behind is made of glass panes and the train track is on the other side. I see a train pulling up. I jump off of the table and begin running along the wall with the train and looking through the glass to see who is in the train. I am hoping John is on it. I've been worried that he would be hurt and not return from his assignment. I see him looking for me from a window of the train. I get to the entrance and greet him with a hug. We chat excitedly for just a few moments, saying how glad we are to see each other and that he is okay. I introduce him to the students and tell them about the assignment he just returned from. When I mentioned Russia, many of the students began getting up and gathering their things. I ask them what they are doing and they say that are leaving. They are not just leaving the meeting; they are leaving the house - for good. They want no part of someone who is connected to this activity with Russia. I can tell many of the students don't know what to do, while others are fine with it. So I begin talking about his assignment and why it is such a good thing for all countries. A few of the students who had begun to leave decided to stay. I watch some of the female students continue to leave. They are wearing very glamorous evening gowns. One is a brown satin and has a train on it that has rows of ruffles on it and is sprinkled with rhinestones. I say something to someone about the inappropriateness of their attire. As we get on with our day, some of the students are bustling about, completing their assigned household tasks. Others are getting together to chat or study. I went and talked to the seamstress about replacing the curtain over their room doors. I told her if nothing else she could make separate curtains for each room, but I would prefer that they each have a door. She said she would talk to maintenance and see if we could do that within our budget. I went to my private living quarters. I am using the bathroom and someone just comes walking in. I don't know if she realized what I was doing. I leaned a bit to my left so I could see her and I told her that this is my private living quarters. She said something about the house map not being very clear about that. This happens one or two more times with 2-3 people coming in together. Now a girl comes in wanting to talk to me. I tell her that is fine. We'll just sit at my desk there to talk. After I've finished with her I went to find the seamstress again to talk to her about the door to my private living quarters. At first the door was a full wood door with a bubbled glass pane in most of the top half of it. On the outside of the door we had something printed on it to designate that it was private quarters. I realized that whatever was on it was not clear enough. Now it seems that the door is just a partial one, more like what you would see on a public bathroom stall with another alongside it. One leads to my private quarters and the other leads to the sewing area. We decide that students are getting confused and coming in the wrong door. But then it seems that there is just one door and the confusion happens when they come through the door and face two hallways. They choose the one to the left that leads to my private quarters instead of the one to the right that leads to the sewing area. Then I suggest that maybe we just need two separate doors. The seamstress is going to once again contact maintenance and have them take care of it. She will also have them change the wording on the door to make sure it is very clear that it is private quarters and they are not to enter. I suppose if I keep it locked at all times it would solve the problem. I'm not sure why this doesn't occur to me then, or why I don't want to do that. My private living quarters have the same curvy walls that were in the other area. Now the location is confusing, as it seems both Grandma F's home and my birth home both. Many of our family members are there. I hear someone shout that Hope and Faith have had their baby. They are relatives. [unknown in waking life.] I run out to the living room and see that the front door is standing open. I go to the door and see a sign, seemingly floating in the air, that announces the birth of the baby. I'm trying to figure out how that sign is out and there and floating like that. Someone points out to me that Daddy has it on a string so it is flying like a kite. The string isn't noticeable at all. I look to my far left and finally spot Daddy. He is running across the front yard because the sign is pulling him along. I'm surprised to see him running that well and it is not bothering him physically at all. It's dark outside. Daddy had been at the hospital with the father. Mother had been there too, but had driven herself because her and Daddy were either divorced or separated. Daddy was still living at our birth home. I don't know where mother was living. I wondered how it was for them to be at the hospital together. There are several cars in the driveway. Mine is one of them. Matthew is there and we are talking about various things. I have to go to work at CAS. I only have a few days left to work there and I don't want to be late and give them the impression that I don't care any longer, or that I'm no longer conscientious about being on time, etc. As I was trying to get ready Matthew kept coming in and asking me questions and talking to me. Most of the time I would have to stop what I was doing, turn my head, and ask him to repeat himself because I either didn't hear or didn't understand what he was saying. He said something to me about his room. I was surprised that he had chosen a room upstairs with all of the college students rather than having the room designated for him downstairs. I'm trying to put my makeup on. I put my mascara on and realize how long it has made my lashes. I look at the tube and see that it is one that I've not used before. I'm very excited that it is working so well. Then I realize they have gotten very clumpy. As I try to fix it I smear it on my cheek. I reapply it and then use my eyelash comb to separate the lashes. After I'm done I decide they look ridiculously long so I decide to try to remove and fix it. As I do the lashes on one eye ends up looking like a sparkling blue and the lashes of the other eye are a sparkling pink. I wonder if I can just go like this - if it's very noticeable. Matthew tries to tell me it's not but I can tell he's lying so I redo it completely. As I'm finally just about ready I realize that I have flight today to the SAID conference and I don't remember what time my flight is. I ask Matthew to go get my ticket for me. He says something, indicating that he doesn't want to and I say, please, in a begging tone. I know it's not going to be easy to describe to him where it is because it is a drawer in one of the small rooms inside my room and I haven't fully settled in at our new home yet. I do my best. The attic has been refurbished to house the student's rooms and that is where my private living quarters are also. He comes back and hasn't found it. Then I realize it is in the safe and tell him where the safe is. I realize I'm going to be an hour late for work. I decide that I'll call Bill C on the way and tell him that I'm running late because of the birth. I'm concerned that my car is blocked in and I'm not going to be able to get out. I found out that Bev was leaving at the same time and that was going to be enough for me to be able to get out. Daddy and someone were emptying things out of the back of my SUV. There were looking at it and talking about it being my new SUV. At that time it looked like a truck, but when I got in to leave it looked like an SUV again. As I got ready to pull out of the driveway I noticed there were cars parked to my left, all along the right side of the road, bumper-to-bumper. It was still just dusk, mostly dark. A car seemed to pull out of our yard from the left side of the road and heading towards me. I noticed it was an older couple. The man was driving and a woman was sitting in the passenger seat drinking a cup of coffee. I looked around to see why all these cars were around. At first I thought maybe one of the neighbors was having a yard sale but decided it was too dark outside, or too early in the morning for that. I went ahead and pulled out of the driveway headed to my left. Just after I did I realized that I had forgotten something and needed to go back to the house. I decided it would be easiest to just park along the road with the other cars and walk back. When I went back I couldn't remember for sure where I parked, or how far away. It seems that I walked two or three blocks. The area looked more like city blocks of an old, small town, than it did like the rural route that our birth home is actually on. Earlier I had been talking with one of my brothers and mentioned a local bar and deli that had closed. They asked me which one. I told them it was a small one on of the corners. It was a little mom and pop business. As I was walking to my SUV, I remembered this conversation and was trying to remember on which of these corners the business used to be. If I could remember then I could tell my brother more precisely where the business had been. As I walked I wasn't even sure I would know my SUV when I saw it, because I hadn't had it very long, it looked so much like so many others, and it was dark outside and little hard to see. As I walk I see about one hundred feet in front me is a large vehicle completely blocking the road. I immediately get upset thinking that this will be yet another delay in my getting to work because I'm not going to be able to get around him at all. I realize that he is moving out of the way. I walk back and forth two or three blocks trying to find my SUV. I see a man with a boat pulled perpendicular to all of the cars parked along the road. It looks like it is against an SUV. At first I think it's mine and I get upset and start looking at the SUV to see if there is any damage. There isn't but then I realize that isn't mine anyway.",

         "Interpret this dream: I had bought Grandma F's house to save it from being torn down. Part of me is very excited to be there and part of me is very worried about moving back to the country, especially to St. Joe. I think Matthew and I talk about it a little. He has the same mixed feelings. There is so much baggage attached to living there. The house was refurbished/remodeled before we closed on the sale. I was in the kitchen talking to someone from my family about what a great job Marlene F's family had done refurbishing this house. The house was much, much larger in the dream than in waking life. I see something in the bottom drawer of the stove and take it out and sat it on top to the left of the stove. It was very hot. I sat it on the counter and it was bubbling. Marlene F came in and took potholders and checked something in the oven that she had been cooking. She looked at me kind of funny, and the dish I had removed from the drawer. I then realized that it wasn't a drawer that I took that out of. It was part of the stove, a broiler drawer, and the dish still needed to cook more. I explained to Marlene F what I had thought and why I had taken it out then I put it back in the oven/drawer. I had decided to rent some of the rooms to college students. This was going to practically pay my mortgage for me, even though I wasn't going to charge them that much. One of the people that was going to move in there, however, was Jo V. I was so excited that she was moving in, for a number of reasons. She is such a dear friend. She can help me in areas that is not a strength of mine, and it would simply be good to have at least one other person there that I know. There are a bunch of college students outside, standing in a row. I went out to talk to them briefly and tell them we're not quite ready for them to come in yet. I tell them that we are going to allow them to choose their rooms in the order that they registered and pay. They all began reaching for their payments. One Asian couple was going to share a room. They weren't married. They handed me a credit card. One I tried to process it, it was denied. I felt bad for them but needed to only accept students who could pay. Now I began wondering if I would be able to actually cash any checks these students give me. As I continue talk to the group I watch the Asian couple walk away, very dejected and worried. They don't know what they're going to do now. I later decide that I have an extra room and I go back outside looking for them. I see them walking along the road. I run to catch up to them and ask them what they plan to do now. They said they were going to try to get a ride to someplace where they could get some money. I suggested that they at least stay with me for the evening, no charge. I tell them they can help the cook in the morning with breakfast and dishes. I can tell they are very grateful for this so they walk back with me. As we're walking back I think about my intensives at GC. Everyone had to sign up to help in the kitchen for at least one meal during the week that we were there. I decide that it would be a good idea to make helping out a part of the rental agreement for all of the students. There would be assigned tasks and they could sign up for the tasks or shifts that work best for them and their schedules. I let them come inside but tell them they have to wait a bit to get their rooms. Jo V comes in and sits down her luggage. I take her on a tour of the house. We're admiring the nice wall-colors they choose. The upstairs looks very much like the scene of a dream that I had in October 2001.

I take her to show her another area. There is an entryway that is split. One way leads to my room and the other leads to a huge sewing area. I know she is going to love having this there.

She must have noticed a look on my face because she quickly said that I do not pay her salary. That her salary is paid through the sewing projects she does for my tenants. This was a very large and oddly shaped room. John, a male friend of mine is there. [I don't know him in waking life.] I am saying goodbye to him as he is getting ready to leave. He is headed off to do something in particular. It is political and is somehow related to Russia. He gets on a train and leaves. As I walk through the hallway past the room doors I see that there are a lot of young people in each room. I decide a lot of them must be visiting friends, but see that some of them are preparing to sleep on the floor for the night.

I've been worried that he would be hurt and not return from his assignment. I see him looking for me from a window of the train. I get to the entrance and greet him with a hug. We chat excitedly for just a few moments, saying how glad we are to see each other and that he is okay. I introduce him to the students and tell them about the assignment he just returned from. When I mentioned Russia, many of the students began getting up and gathering their things. I ask them what they are doing and they say that are leaving. They are not just leaving the meeting; they are leaving the house - for good. They want no part of someone who is connected to this activity with Russia. I can tell many of the students don't know what to do, while others are fine with it. So I begin talking about his assignment and why it is such a good thing for all countries. A few of the students who had begun to leave decided to stay. I watch some of the female students continue to leave. They are wearing very glamorous evening gowns. One is a brown satin and has a train on it that has rows of ruffles on it and is sprinkled with rhinestones. I say something to someone about the inappropriateness of their attire. As we get on with our day, some of the students are bustling about, completing their assigned household tasks. Others are getting together to chat or study. I went and talked to the seamstress about replacing the curtain over their room doors. I told her if nothing else she could make separate curtains for each room, but I would prefer that they each have a door. She said she would talk to maintenance and see if we could do that within our budget. I went to my private living quarters. I am using the bathroom and someone just comes walking in. I don't know if she realized what I was doing. I leaned a bit to my left so I could see her and I told her that this is my private living quarters. She said something about the house map not being very clear about that. This happens one or two more times with 2-3 people coming in together. Now a girl comes in wanting to talk to me. I tell her that is fine. We'll just sit at my desk there to talk. After I've finished with her I went to find the seamstress again to talk to her about the door to my private living quarters. At first the door was a full wood door with a bubbled glass pane in most of the top half of it. On the outside of the door we had something printed on it to designate that it was private quarters. I realized that whatever was on it was not clear enough. Now it seems that the door is just a partial one, more like what you would see on a public bathroom stall with another alongside it. One leads to my private quarters and the other leads to the sewing area. We decide that students are getting confused and coming in the wrong door. But then it seems that there is just one door and the confusion happens when they come through the door and face two hallways. They choose the one to the left that leads to my private quarters instead of the one to the right that leads to the sewing area. Then I suggest that maybe we just need two separate doors. The seamstress is going to once again contact maintenance and have them take care of it. She will also have them change the wording on the door to make sure it is very clear that it is private quarters and they are not to enter. I suppose if I keep it locked at all times it would solve the problem. I'm not sure why this doesn't occur to me then, or why I don't want to do that. My private living quarters have the same curvy walls that were in the other area. Now the location is confusing, as it seems both Grandma F's home and my birth home both. Many of our family members are there. I hear someone shout that Hope and Faith have had their baby. They are relatives. [unknown in waking life.] I run out to the living room and see that the front door is standing open. I go to the door and see a sign, seemingly floating in the air, that announces the birth of the baby. I'm trying to figure out how that sign is out and there and floating like that. Someone points out to me that Daddy has it on a string so it is flying like a kite. The string isn't noticeable at all. I look to my far left and finally spot Daddy. He is running across the front yard because the sign is pulling him along. I'm surprised to see him running that well and it is not bothering him physically at all. It's dark outside. Daddy had been at the hospital with the father. Mother had been there too, but had driven herself because her and Daddy were either divorced or separated. Daddy was still living at our birth home. I don't know where mother was living. I wondered how it was for them to be at the hospital together. There are several cars in the driveway. Mine is one of them. Matthew is there and we are talking about various things. I have to go to work at CAS. I only have a few days left to work there and I don't want to be late and give them the impression that I don't care any longer, or that I'm no longer conscientious about being on time, etc. As I was trying to get ready Matthew kept coming in and asking me questions and talking to me. Most of the time I would have to stop what I was doing, turn my head, and ask him to repeat himself because I either didn't hear or didn't understand what he was saying. He said something to me about his room. I was surprised that he had chosen a room upstairs with all of the college students rather than having the room designated for him downstairs. I'm trying to put my makeup on. I put my mascara on and realize how long it has made my lashes. I look at the tube and see that it is one that I've not used before. I'm very excited that it is working so well. Then I realize they have gotten very clumpy. As I try to fix it I smear it on my cheek. I reapply it and then use my eyelash comb to separate the lashes. After I'm done I decide they look ridiculously long so I decide to try to remove and fix it. As I do the lashes on one eye ends up looking like a sparkling blue and the lashes of the other eye are a sparkling pink. I wonder if I can just go like this - if it's very noticeable. Matthew tries to tell me it's not but I can tell he's lying so I redo it completely. As I'm finally just about ready I realize that I have flight today to the SAID conference and I don't remember what time my flight is. I ask Matthew to go get my ticket for me. He says something, indicating that he doesn't want to and I say, please, in a begging tone. I know it's not going to be easy to describe to him where it is because it is a drawer in one of the small rooms inside my room and I haven't fully settled in at our new home yet. I do my best. The attic has been refurbished to house the student's rooms and that is where my private living quarters are also. He comes back and hasn't found it. Then I realize it is in the safe and tell him where the safe is. I realize I'm going to be an hour late for work. I decide that I'll call Bill C on the way and tell him that I'm running late because of the birth. I'm concerned that my car is blocked in and I'm not going to be able to get out. I found out that Bev was leaving at the same time and that was going to be enough for me to be able to get out. Daddy and someone were emptying things out of the back of my SUV. There were looking at it and talking about it being my new SUV. At that time it looked like a truck, but when I got in to leave it looked like an SUV again. As I got ready to pull out of the driveway I noticed there were cars parked to my left, all along the right side of the road, bumper-to-bumper. It was still just dusk, mostly dark. A car seemed to pull out of our yard from the left side of the road and heading towards me. I noticed it was an older couple. The man was driving and a woman was sitting in the passenger seat drinking a cup of coffee. I looked around to see why all these cars were around. At first I thought maybe one of the neighbors was having a yard sale but decided it was too dark outside, or too early in the morning for that. I went ahead and pulled out of the driveway headed to my left. Just after I did I realized that I had forgotten something and needed to go back to the house. I decided it would be easiest to just park along the road with the other cars and walk back. When I went back I couldn't remember for sure where I parked, or how far away. It seems that I walked two or three blocks. The area looked more like city blocks of an old, small town, than it did like the rural route that our birth home is actually on. Earlier I had been talking with one of my brothers and mentioned a local bar and deli that had closed. They asked me which one. I told them it was a small one on of the corners. It was a little mom and pop business. As I was walking to my SUV, I remembered this conversation and was trying to remember on which of these corners the business used to be. If I could remember then I could tell my brother more precisely where the business had been. As I walked I wasn't even sure I would know my SUV when I saw it, because I hadn't had it very long, it looked so much like so many others, and it was dark outside and little hard to see. As I walk I see about one hundred feet in front me is a large vehicle completely blocking the road. I immediately get upset thinking that this will be yet another delay in my getting to work because I'm not going to be able to get around him at all. I realize that he is moving out of the way. I walk back and forth two or three blocks trying to find my SUV. I see a man with a boat pulled perpendicular to all of the cars parked along the road. It looks like it is against an SUV. At first I think it's mine and I get upset and start looking at the SUV to see if there is any damage. There isn't but then I realize that isn't mine anyway.\nSymbols: - Bake-house: To see a bake-house in your dream signifies danger and pitfalls that you may be encountering in your waking life.\n - Gift: To open a gift and find something disgusting inside symbolizes disappointments or unexpected failures.\n - Stove: To see a stove in your dream symbolizes a developing awareness.

         "I was working for SVH. I had two sons. One was Matthew's current age and one much younger. They were helping me get things ready so I could leave for the day and part of it was reconciling the cash. The boys were arguing about something. I told the older one that he needed to be patient with the younger one, because even the older one was getting impatient with me at that time about wanting to do things differently than I wanted him to. That's what was happening with the little one also. The older one was hassling him, trying to make him do it a certain way. I said to the older one, but you're getting upset with me right now for the very same thing. You don't want me to show you how I want it done or how it needs to be done. You want me to just let you do it your way. When we were in our car, ready to go home, it was just Matthew at his current age and myself. We were driving a pickup truck. He started to back up and I started saying, The gate is down! The gate is down! I had to say it 4-5 times before he stopped. By the time he stopped it was too late. He had hit another vehicle so the gate lifted the other car, moved it over a bit, and pushed it back. In doing so, he hurt two other boys. One was Matthew's current age. The other was the age of the younger Matthew in the dream earlier. The younger one wasn't seriously injured but the older one was fighting for his life, he was unconscious. The doctors and nurses kept telling me that they didn't know if he would pull through or not. I didn't want to leave the hospital because I was so worried about the boy and I was frustrated with Matthew. I felt it happened because of a typical behavior of his, not listening to words of caution, thinking that he already knows best. Until something happens, he tends to have to learn his lessons the hard way. I was frustrated because I didn't want someone to have to lose their life before Matthew would start driving more carefully and about being more open to other people's advice. I was very concerned and upset. I took to the younger boy and asked him if he believed in God. His grandmother was there. One of them said that they did. I was cleaning the equipment around the older boy's bed. Something I did seemed to make a difference. There seemed to be a turn for the better. As I was cleaning I kept praying and praying asking God to please let him pull through. Part of me felt as though I was praying for the boy for the wrong reason. I really wanted him to pull through for himself and for his family, but also for Matthew. I felt really bad about what happened and because Matthew is my son. Even though he is 19, I still feel very responsible for him and the person he is and his behavior. From that respect I felt horrible about what happened. So I was praying for our sake as well. Whatever I did caused a slight improvement. The doctors were still telling us to be very cautious and not get overly optimistic. He said it was a good sign but it did not mean that he was completely out of danger. The little boy said he saw his brother holding out his hand for him and he thought that meant that he was going to be okay. I wanted to say to the boy, you know, if you see him holding out his hand, maybe that means that God is holding out his hand for your brother, and we should take comfort in that. It doesn't matter if God is going to walk him home to heaven or walk him home to you. We should take comfort that God is going to walk with him. But I didn't say it because I wasn't sure if it was an appropriate thing for me to say. Would it be appropriate for me to say as the person I was in the dream and am now? Would it be appropriate for me to say as a spiritual director? Does it make a difference? I knew some of the nurses and other employees because I worked there. We were going to start having monthly movie nights at our department, or center, where we work. We may have just done one. I think it may have been two connected departments and I worked in the other. I was going to be in charge of this with a couple of nurses from the other department. That particular time we had done it in their department. I was walking around, cleaning up, sweeping the floors. There was something about the fact that we shouldn't spend our time doing that. I thought I should be able to do that if I wanted to. It makes things look better and I don't mind sweeping up after someone else. There was a discussion about that room not being very important compared to what we do. Maybe even that didn't support our basic philosophies or values. I'm not sure I understand that. I continued to sweep and clean up. In fact, in the one area where the other nurses were, there were doors open and I was trying to sweep some of the leaves up and outside. The leaves were blowing in and around the room. It didn't seem to bother me. I was aware of it, but it wasn't frustrating me that more leaves kept blowing back in. I thought I would just do the best that I could. I had moved back to my area and was sweeping one of the rooms there. I thought the room I was in would be a nice place to have the monthly movie nights and that I should check with my manager to see if they would mind that. It's a room that we could stretch out; maybe even lay on the floor. I was thinking how comfortable the basic plastic molded chairs in this room would be compared to the student chairs with desktops that were in the other room. Then I thought maybe not. At first I had the impression that it was carpeted but it wasn't. I started to wonder if there was a screen in there that we could show the movie on. I don't think there was and I didn't know what would be involved in getting one in there. I finally decided it would just be best to continue using the room that we had used. Somehow I knew that Br. Barry had been brought in on this conversation about to sweep or not to sweep. It seems that he could see where we were both coming from, and didn't really see the problem if I had the time or even if I wanted to do it on my own time. I realized that no one had been talking to the older boy who had been hurt. I thought maybe I should go tell his younger brother that he should go talk to him. Some people believe that people who are unconscious or in a coma can hear you talk to them or that it does make a difference in their recovery. I thought it might be good for the younger boy as well, to talk to his brother. Then I thought I should tell Matthew that as well. Matthew should go talk to the young man and make his peace with the situation in case the boy didn't make it. I didn't think Matthew had any idea it would be for him if this young man doesn't pull through. I felt it was very important that he go talk to him, to apologize, or whatever else he felt he needed to say. Again, I didn't know if that was appropriate to tell the two of them to go talk to them. I was in training to become a doctor. I was seeing this patient, even though I realized that I had two more years before I would actually be a doctor. I was referring to myself as a doctor to her. It wasn't until later that I realized that was inappropriate and I should clarify to her that I still had two more years of education. Whatever her problem was, I had taken care of it for her. I had gone into this classroom where we were later going to be viewing a movie together. The mother of the woman whom I had treated, or spoken with, was there. She was waiting for her daughter so they could go home. Ben D was in this room. I was excited to see him there. I was debating what I should say to him, should I express my personal interest, was there something that I could say to get him to ask me out. I just tried to be very kind, friendly, and not overly so. I was surprised that he was there. I learned that he had come to attend a lecture and that he does this quite often. So then I thought I should tell him if he is ever in the city where I live that he should give me a call and we could have dinner, similar to what he had said to me in waking life. I went into the room a few times and chatted with him briefly. The mother of this woman that I had treated was there also. I finally realized that Ben D was hanging around to take her to dinner after her daughter was finished there. This disappointed me, that he was there to socialize with this other woman, and he wasn't expressing any additional interest in seeing me socially. I was stewing over this, wondering if there was anything that I could or should do or say. I was contemplating how I was feeling about this experience and what, if anything, I should do. The young man did die. As soon as Matthew heard, he broke down in tears. He was very upset. I had not had the opportunity to suggest that he talk to the young man, even though the young man was in a coma. We were at home and Matthew was in the shower trying to relax. I was going to go rub his back or something to help him relax. I had a method or ritual or something to try to help him relax. aromatherapy, music, etc. It occurred to me that some people might find this inappropriate but since we were both in bathing suits I decided that it was fine. I knew how upset Matthew was and I wanted to help him. but myself as well because I was also very upset by the whole thing. Prior to this, there were approximately 20 workmen outside of my house doing some repairs. They had finished their work. On the kitchen counter there was a 1 _ inch to 2-inch gap between the cabinet and the counter. kind of like a hole. It was probably 12 inches long but it was arched. I thought it was terrible. One of them said there was nothing that could be done. I was going to talk to one of the other workers to verify that or to find someone who could fix it. Then there were even more people there. People that I knew. They wanted to know about this ritual that I use for relaxation. They wanted to witness it. They were waiting for me to prepare everything. Probably 15 of them were waiting outside. It was very hot, so they had removed their shirts. I had gone out for a minute. I jokingly said something about fifteen shirtless men sitting in my front yard and that not happening very often. They all laughed. I had some of the people helping me collect candles. My shower was something like you would see in a health club. It was almost like three shower stalls, divided, but the partition-dividers were clear so you could see through them, and they were long and narrow. Lots of people had gathered in these three shower stalls to watch the ritual. They were all clothed. They didn't seem to be showering, but the water was on. They were sitting in a row, because the stalls were long and narrow and they couldn't stand or sit 2 or 3 people across. I told them that to do the ritual I would need all of the people out of there. They all cleared out and were helping me put the candles in but they were putting them in the wrong places. In the one shower stall that I was going to be using there were quite a few plants on the one end, ivy and hanging plants, etc. I was placing the candles very carefully so they wouldn't light the plants on fire. I had them replace some of the candles because I only wanted candles that were either white or very dark colors such as maroon, green and navy. There was also a man in there filming it. But he was filming it while all the other people were in there. I said, I do believe it may be useful for people to have a video of this ritual because they could see it being performed and learn to use it for themselves or their loved ones. However, I think it should be done right if you are going to do it. He found a blank tape that was a minute or two long. I told him that wasn't really going to do much good. Then he found another one that was much longer. I had two women friends, close to me. I didn't have a place to change into my swimsuit. There were so many people around I couldn't find a private place to change. I thought I had found a place but then that didn't work out. Then all these men and some other people decided they would create a barrier for me by surrounding me, with their backs to me, so I could change. I did that. Two of the women who were particularly close to me were trying to help me. I wanted to slip it down over my head and they said that wouldn't work. They said I wouldn't be able to keep myself covered that way so I stepped into the swimsuit and pulled it up. I removed my top while they simultaneously pulled my swimsuit up. This worked very well. I went into the shower. When Matthew came in he was a very small child, maybe only one year old. I'm not sure he could even sit up by himself. I was sitting on the floor of the shower and he was sitting with me, between my legs but facing away from me, as a parent and child might sit on the floor when playing. I was bathing him and all the candles were lit.",

I was stewing over this, wondering if there was anything that I could or should do or say. I was contemplating how I was feeling about this experience and what, if anything, I should do. The young man did die. As soon as Matthew heard, he broke down in tears. He was very upset. I had not had the opportunity to suggest that he talk to the young man, even though the young man was in a coma. We were at home and Matthew was in the shower trying to relax. I was going to go rub his back or something to help him relax. I had a method or ritual or something to try to help him relax. aromatherapy, music, etc. It occurred to me that some people might find this inappropriate but since we were both in bathing suits I decided that it was fine. I knew how upset Matthew was and I wanted to help him. but myself as well because I was also very upset by the whole thing. Prior to this, there were approximately 20 workmen outside of my house doing some repairs. They had finished their work. On the kitchen counter there was a 1 _ inch to 2-inch gap between the cabinet and the counter. kind of like a hole. It was probably 12 inches long but it was arched. I thought it was terrible. One of them said there was nothing that could be done. I was going to talk to one of the other workers to verify that or to find someone who could fix it. Then there were even more people there. People that I knew. They wanted to know about this ritual that I use for relaxation. They wanted to witness it. They were waiting for me to prepare everything. Probably 15 of them were waiting outside. It was very hot, so they had removed their shirts. I had gone out for a minute. I jokingly said something about fifteen shirtless men sitting in my front yard and that not happening very often. They all laughed. I had some of the people helping me collect candles. My shower was something like you would see in a health club. It was almost like three shower stalls, divided, but the partition-dividers were clear so you could see through them, and they were long and narrow. Lots of people had gathered in these three shower stalls to watch the ritual. They were all clothed. They didn't seem to be showering, but the water was on. They were sitting in a row, because the stalls were long and narrow and they couldn't stand or sit 2 or 3 people across. I told them that to do the ritual I would need all of the people out of there. They all cleared out and were helping me put the candles in but they were putting them in the wrong places. In the one shower stall that I was going to be using there were quite a few plants on the one end, ivy and hanging plants, etc. I was placing the candles very carefully so they wouldn't light the plants on fire. I had them replace some of the candles because I only wanted candles that were either white or very dark colors such as maroon, green and navy. There was also a man in there filming it. But he was filming it while all the other people were in there. I said, I do believe it may be useful for people to have a video of this ritual because they could see it being performed and learn to use it for themselves or their loved ones. However, I think it should be done right if you are going to do it. He found a blank tape that was a minute or two long. I told him that wasn't really going to do much good. Then he found another one that was much longer. I had two women friends, close to me. I didn't have a place to change into my swimsuit. There were so many people around I couldn't find a private place to change. I thought I had found a place but then that didn't work out. Then all these men and some other people decided they would create a barrier for me by surrounding me, with their backs to me, so I could change. I did that. Two of the women who were particularly close to me were trying to help me. I wanted to slip it down over my head and they said that wouldn't work. They said I wouldn't be able to keep myself covered that way so I stepped into the swimsuit and pulled it up. I removed my top while they simultaneously pulled my swimsuit up. This worked very well. I went into the shower. When Matthew came in he was a very small child, maybe only one year old. I'm not sure he could even sit up by himself. I was sitting on the floor of the shower and he was sitting with me, between my legs but facing away from me, as a parent and child might sit on the floor when playing. I was bathing him and all the candles were lit.\nSymbols: - Father: To dream that your father is angry at you indicates that you are doing something that he may disapprove. The dream may also be a projection of your own anger towards him. There are some unresolved issues that need to be worked out.\n - Dispute: To dream that you are having disputes with others suggest that you are trying to resolve some internal conflict or some unsettled issue in your waking life. Consider the symbolism of what is the dispute you are having. Alternatively, the dream indicates that you may be unfairly judging others.\n - Ditch: DitchThe dream may also be on pun on ditching school, work, appointment, or something that you are now feeling guilty about.\n - Sibling Rivalry: To dream of sibling rivalry suggests feelings of insecurity or doubt. You are feeling a lack of love.\n - Age: If you are a parent and dream that your child is younger than he or she really is, then it means that you are longing for the past. Perhaps you feel that you are no longer important and wish to regress back to a period where you were more needed. Time is passing you by.",

         "Matthew and I are at Kings Island. We hadn't gone there for entertainment, but for some other reason. We were there early in the day. We were sitting there waiting for something or someone and I suggested to Matthew that maybe we could ride the roller coaster while we're there. He didn't immediately agree or disagree with me. Then we got up and started walking, maybe towards the roller coaster. We see Bev and John S. They are riding in something like a golf cart. They pull up along side us and we all stop to talk. We hadn't expected to see them. I'm thinking about the fact that I bet they come more often now that they have this cart because they don't have to do so much walking. That would make it less tiring and more enjoyable. They don't have their children with them. They take off again and Matthew and I decide to try to catch up with them. We get stopped in the crowd because there are so many people around we can't get through. Matthew sees something up ahead of us and says something like, oh there's....I can't remember what he said it was. I think it had something to do with us trying to catch up to Bev and John. He took off to go up to whatever it was. I think he was going to come right back. I stood there and waited and waited but he didn't come back. I got kind of upset. I thought he was just going 30 or 40 feet ahead of me. I finally made my way up there and he was no where to be seen. Then I got upset because I really do not like being in crowds, especially not alone. And no longer like being in unfamiliar places alone either. I was trying not to feel too panicked. Now, I'm standing next to one of the rides. At least that's what I think it is originally but it seems to have morphed into something that looks like a single slide, not that high, that ends in a single spiral at the bottom. People come down the slide and continue around this single spiral. I'm watching people come down. There are two employees at the top of the slide helping people. There are also a couple of employees at the bottom of the slide helping. Then I see a bunch of stuff come down the slide instead of people. It's stuff like people's belongings and bed linens and bath towels. Some of it is stuffed animals. As I'm standing there watching this I realize that there are groups of people, may families and this is a kind of entryway into the park. These groups of people are there for a specific reason other than to be visitors or for the entertainment and attractions. The employees are helping these groups of people enter the park through this slide. The groups of people have brought this stuff with them that I saw coming down the slide. Someone is taking the stuffed animals off of the slide one by one. The are relatively small, maybe 12-18 inches in length and not that big in width. They are more long and thin stuffed animals than short and chubby like a teddy bear. Someone is handing them to me. There is some kind of a shelf or box like container that is open on the side. They are handing the stuffed animals to me to stand them in this container. They want me to start at one end and line them up that way. It is only as deep as the stuffed animals are wide. Apparently I wasn't doing it the way they wanted me to and they showed me that they wanted the first one to face the wall of the container and then line each of the others up behind the first one facing the same way. It only held four or five of them. I'm in an indoor, underground location. The families each have their own area down there. It is a very long, not very wide, almost tunnel like area. The ceilings don't feel very high. The areas for each of the families are not divided by walls. In each area there is a platform type thing that is about five or six feet tall, maybe three feet wide, and about 10 or 12 feet long. On each and there is a set of steps leading up to the platform. The each look a little different than the others, in color or how they are constructed. For example, some of them may be carpeted, some are painted but in different colors, etc. as I'm walking through this area I realize that each of these families, or groups, are there for a competition. Perhaps it is a talent competition. These platforms are for them to practice on. They each have very different things that they are doing though, so it gives the feeling of something like a variety show or a circus, where there are lots of different types of acts. I'm walking through here trying to find Matthew, and I'm getting very frustrated. I decide that I need to go back up above ground to find him but now I can't find a place to go back above ground. All of these individual family areas with all of these staircases is causing me to feel more disoriented and confused. I see someone that I think maybe an employee there so I stop and ask them for directions to get back above ground. They try to give me directions but I think I must get confused again because I don't find it. I go back to the same person to ask again but they seemed to be irritated with me now. So I just walk away and keep trying myself. I finally find Matthew down there. He knows the way back above ground so we are going back up together and then go home. The place that we go up above ground is at the end of the tunnel. As we approach I see an area with exercise equipment. However, it's very unusual looking equipment, like nothing I've seen before. Some of it reminds me of the type of equipment a football team which used for practice, like the things they would use to practice tackling or things that they would be pushing against with their shoulders as they try to run forward. I feel very tense, like I have a lot of built-up anxiety or stress. I look at this equipment and think it might be a very good way for me to get rid of some of this tension. I'm standing there doing something with some of it trying to figure out how to use it. I asked Matthew, and he shows me how to use it. I noticed these things attached to some of the equipment. I see the same things are also attached some places on the walls. They look like a rectangular boxes and if you open them they contain plastic bottles for water or beverages. They look very dirty or a nasty. I decide it would be a nice thing to do to clean them up for whoever uses them. So go ahead and I clean them up and then someone who works there walks up to me. I told him what I did. Instead of appreciating it he seems bothered by the fact that I did this. Thank you I are now ready to go above ground. The way to get up is to climb up a ladder that is attached to the end wall. There is a fairly small opening at the top of the ladder that we have to crawl through to get out. Before we climb up the ladder we see these black rectangular kind of shape to object leaning against the wall. Matthew suggest that we each take one up with us to use and once we get through the opening. Apparently, once we get through the opening, we can't just stand up and walk through the park. I am now with three other people and Matthew is not one of those. We are trying to escape. We each of one of these black things though they now seem to be different sizes and shapes. We are going to use them as some kind of transportation, kind of like a sled though I don't know what is going to propel us. We see some other kind of objects and we each take two. There might be more than two. One appears to be something to sit on and the other, or others, we will use to propel us forward. However it is that they work were going to use them to get away, or to escape. It seems as though we are outdoors now and on pavement just inside the park. It looks like we are exiting the park on to a road. The place that were exiting from and the road they were exiting on to appears to have a downward slope. We are exiting at an angle on to the road. It reminds me of the way an entrance ramp to the highway enters on to the highway. And I we're concerned and one because of the traffic and cars being able to see us clearly with us being on these objects and so close to the ground also. It feels very dangerous. It seems to me that we'd pull off and stop to figure out what to do. Now we're running through the inside of a building, still in an effort to escape. The building looks like a huge warehouse and there is stuff everywhere. They're apparently isn't even room to walk, because to get through we have to actually run across the top of these piles all of boxes and such. Some of the piles of things aren't boxes, they are very soft and plush is maybe a good word to describe them. Almost as though they are piles of blankets or pillows. As we're doing this we notice some very large objects that are rectangular in shape. Like the thing is that we were using before they are plastic but these are in a variety of colors. I grab one that is lime green. They are long enough that we can sit upright on them and stretch out our legs in front of us. We each take one and are using them as sleds on something that I can best describe as a very long slide that goes through this building.But it's not straight, but rather winds through the building until we exit. This seems to happen several times. We exit one building and find ourselves in another find some kind of objects to use and slide our way winding through the building until we exit again and then the same thing happens over. At one point we exit on to a green grassy area. There are four or so employees each standing with a customer or guest, working with them to practice their golf putting. I hear one of the employees say that the park has a service for guests, where the guests can request the service of one of these employees for an entire day and the employee will help the guest with anything they want help with. I quickly tell the three people that I'm with about this. I suggest that maybe they can help us get away since they are required to help us with anything that we ask for help with. I tell them that I think it will be easier for us to get away if we have these employees hoping each of us. Maybe I think it's because they know their way around this area better, or maybe I think it's because if there's two of us on each of these objects we will be better able to get away simply because of having more manpower. So we end up telling for the employees that we want their services and so they have to help us. So we now each have an employee with us on these objects that we are trying to get away on. So now as were sliding through the building each of us with an employee with us on our slide it's the last time that this happens. The buildings are all fairly dark and dingy. There is no visible color, and very little light. The area that were moving through is just wide enough for these things that were using as sleds. The thing that we're sliding on through each of these buildings seems to change from time to time. As we get close to exiting this final building the employees warned us that we need to be very careful and try to slow ourselves down because we will be exiting onto water. They tell us that the water will become ice. We need to be especially careful at that point. It would enter the ice to fast we could get turned over and injured. So, we are all trying to slow down and brace ourselves preparing for this. I am second in line of before us and I see a head of me were getting ready to exit the building the water on the other side and it's like the rushing water. I become nervous and tense, wondering if we can even enter the water without getting dumped over. One as we get close to the place where the water turns to ice I notice something on the wall to my right. The wall itself appears to be gray cement. It looks like there is something like a foam forming on this wall. It reminds me of the type of insulation foam that is used in buildings, where they spray it on and then it expands, except it's not nearly that large. It is maybe an inch or two high but runs along the wall. The employee in front of me points to it and tells me that this is the ice forming. I turned a bit to my right and point this out to the person behind me and tell down that this employee has told me that this is the ice forming. So as the sled in front of me approaches the ice they managed to slow themselves down an off so they can enter the eye is more slowly and carefully so as not to get turned over and harmed. All I and the employee with me do the same thing as do the people behind us. We don't go very far until we see something running two are right that looks like a rail fence made of two by fours. Do to people on the sled in front of me slide underneath the lowest rail and down a very short but somewhat steep hill to the ground below. I can see that there are a lot of people standing down there watching for us. This appears to be a good thing, that these people recognize that we are helping someone. As the two people, the person who is with me originally and the employee, in front of me land on the ground below and stand up, some of the people who have been standing around watching run up to them to greet and hug them. The two people with me then go into a nearby building to get warm. I and the employee with me now does the same thing. And those behind me then do the same thing.",

         "The dream started off in sort of an ancient Greek stage, probably because I was reading some Greek drama last night. It seemed that when someone died that there was this huge massive tunnel under the, where apparently the spirit went and certain people who had been Christian? in life could follow them a certain way thru this maze and, for instance, it was very much made a point of that the nurse could follow it a short way and if this had been a man in white, the white could follow it the furthest of all. And for this purpose one had keys, small little keys with a certain number on them and these numbers could be from one to ten and they corresponded to the numbers of the tunnels and labyrinths in the maze. The nurse would get one key and the wife would get three. Now apparently in this dream my husband had died, although I wasn't exactly myself, so my husband wouldn't be exactly the man I'm married to. But I got three keys and the nurse got a key which was numbered 7 and I got one with numbers 3, 7, and 10. So I went out, first I went down, these were wooden and were ruins in the start of this tunnel bit. I went down thru the nurse's door, which was an ordinary door, and I looked around there for a few minutes. It was old and dusty and it was closed up. It was like an attic or something. I went back up and there was a little door on the side of the wall here which was, I had a key for, but it was a small door and I had to get down on my hands and knees to get thru and I didn't much like it. It gave me sort of claustrophobia, but I did. I was very much worried about losing the keys in the cracks in the floor, and I thought if I drop these keys, there were very small, very thin, if they slip thru the cracks, then I won't have any way to get back because you're supposed to lock the doors behind you when you went thru them. So I held on to them very tightly. I was in another room, this shut-up looking room, which was like the one I had been in before in the nurse's part of the tunnel, and there was another small door leading out of it on the other side, so I decided to go out of it and I did. Then this is a little vague in my mind, but I think I was wandering around in a tunnel or a level or whatever it was, and this maze was completely fantastic. It's beyond words to describe the thing because tunnels and tunnels and tunnels intersected each other and it might be any from one thru ten. I guess in actual practice most of them seemed to be numbered with the keys I had and there was marked with the numbers right into each of these, and you could just wander forever. You would never get to the end of these things and it first seemed they were all closed in tunnels, and then I decided to stop traveling. So I took the opportunity to get out onto this 7 and then I was outside on this ramp and all these ramps were painted gray with different levels. There were stairs going up and down, usually very short ones. Even though they were steps, they didn't look like ordinary flights of stairs, but anyway I was outside and I was sort of glad to be outside. It was fairly pretty. All of these were off the ground. There were none of them that were right on the ground, but there were no rails on either side of the thing. It gave the appearance of being close to the ground because there were trees and things or bushes and vines and things around it. As I went along this ramp or whatever you want to call it, I came to a place where there was a room and there was a big picture window in it, and I could see somebody sitting inside it. I passed thru other places, but they had all been empty. They were all furnished. They weren't this attic type room that I had first been in, but they were empty. But this one had somebody sitting in it and it was this Negro man about 40 or so studying, and he has a sort of evil look about him. I went around and I pounded at the door. When he opened the door, I asked him something. I think I asked him if he knew where somebody was or if  he had seen them or something, but he hadn't, so I went on and I was still outside and it got more and more lovely. It was sort of an Alice in Wonderland type of scene. What I mean by this is a Walt Disney Alice in Wonderland with all these flowers growing up around on either side of this ramp, all very lush and pretty. Sort of unusual flowers too. They didn't have quite a real look about them. So I came to another room which had this boy sitting in it and the boy was about 14 and he was reading something. I knocked on the door and he came to it and let me in and for some reason I was very happy to see him. I never saw him before that I know of, but I was sort of attracted by him. I wanted to kiss him, but he pushed me away and said no because his parents were in the next room. And I thought this was very unusual because I thought most people didn't get here all in one group. It really did seem to be in the underworld or after death and I wondered how he and his parents could have all gotten here at the same time and all be in the same place. His parents were very, very old. They were white-haired and they were both tall and thin, and they were just sitting in the next room on straight back chairs with their hands folded, not looking exactly dead like, but like they might have been in their 70's. It seemed the boy didn't say anything, his parents didn't say anything, but it seems that I understood or knew somehow that this boy had killed somebody or was some sort of psychotic and had been sent here and his parents had come as guardians to be sure he didn't do anything like this again, although who he was planning to kill, I'm not sure since it seemed to be the world of the dead. And even though these people are flesh and blood and quite alive, and yet they were dead in some way. I wasn't. I was, I had gotten down here sort of free or something, but at any rate I don't know exactly what happened. But all of a sudden I knew that this boy was dangerous and he was going to try to kill me or something. He had a knife and this piece of wood about a foot and a half long or so, and I had a piece of wood too. I don't know where I had found it, but it wasn't as long as his and he was trying to hit me with this piece of wood. I was trying to fight him off, but I knew that I wouldn't be too successful because his was longer than mine. So we started running thru all these lovely ramps and walkways thru all these pass ways, these rooms, around, upstairs and so forth in this long flight. Even though we were both running very fast, neither one of us seemed to get tired, and I wasn't really particularly scared. But I just wanted to get away from him. Something or somehow another I got his knife away from him. It was one of these, like a Boy Scout knife or some pocket knife, and I decided I would just get rid of him. And so I sort of stabbed him in his chest, but not very hard, cause I really couldn't, and I was going to make him jump off the ramp and just, well, it wasn't that far down to the ground, but at least I would get rid of him because he wouldn't be able to get back on it. So I kept threatening him with it and telling him to jump over the edge, but he wouldn't do it, and so finally, even though I had this knife, I started running away from him again. This time I was trying to get rid of him and remembered my keys and knew I could get rid of him by going into the doors numbered this, but I didn't know what keys he might have and I didn't know if he could follow me or not. I had this feeling he wouldn't be able to, but still to stop long enough to open the door and then lock it again, he would catch up with me. So I was running and running and we ran up, finally we came to where, in fact, the ramp did run right along the ground and there was a big plain, flat and just with grass on it. This ramp or walkway now you might call it was a big building which was a school and so we ran there. I was, of course, running away from him and I tried to lose myself in the mazes of this school some way. But even though I ran inside the building and started running down the stairs, he could easily spot me because all the girls in the school had these white lab coats and I didn't. I just had ordinary clothes, sort of dark clothes, and so I ran down some flights of stairs with him running after me, and I got down to the place where all these Negro janitors were going home and they were all lined up. There was this immense number of them and they were just all lined up in a row, and they had the same outfits. There was something strange about them because they were all so much alike, but then I knew they'd be going down into the tunnel and it would be different from the ones we ordinarily used, and so I knew if I got in there with them, this other person wouldn't' suspect where I was, so I did get in and the door was closed behind me and I was safe. Then the scene shifted to a larger view. I believe there was a P.A. system and an announcement was made over it that this girl had just reached the gift shop. And I think it was called the Shop of Mercy and Hate on the 3rd level, and that, therefore, she was free and this girl was me. When you got to this shop apparently, whatever it was, you had your choice between these two things, and if you picked the right one, you would be able to go. If you were dead when you reached this and you wanted to, you would be able to get back to the living world again. Even though I wasn't dead, but this also I was going to get. So the boy was sort of upset that he had missed out on this, and so he went up around the ramps and walkways till he got close to where the gift shop was supposed to be, and there the girl came out and she was thinking, well, even though this boy had been chasing her and she hadn't liked it, that if she saw him she would be merciful to him. And she was walking along with this person, whether it was a man or woman, I don't know, all dressed in white, some sort of angel, I guess, a very superior being. There was a shelf over the door and I believe it was the door to the gift shop that had all these cheeses sitting on it and most of these were, I forget the name of them, the kind that are wrapped in wax and some of them weren't. And apparently it had rained because some of them were soggy looking, but I was sort of back with this girl now and had a package of cheese, and it wasn't quite the same kind, but it was unusual cheese. And I don't think I ever saw one exactly like it because it had a lot of holes in it like Swiss cheese, and it was sliced very thin and it had sort of a reddish something, coloration, some fluid. Well, this boy was walking along behind us and I had this cheese, and so I stopped and asked him if he wanted some. I don't know, but anyway he did, and so I and this angel character and this boy all stood around and ate several slices of cheese and bread and apparently I was going off to the airport or something to be taken back to where I was supposed to be, and this is where I and the angel were headed to, the airport. Right then we were just standing there eating this cheese and that was about the end of the dream.",

         "I was the housekeeper for a man and his young son, similar to the movie Sleepless in Seattle. I had been working for them for nearly a year when they began the search for a new wife for the man. I was in love with him by this time. They found his new wife and I was experiencing the expected feelings about the entire situation, but I did not end my employment there. I did not feel the marriage would work out and I didn't want the man to feel worse when he found himself without a wife or a housekeeper. Shortly after they married, the wife became pregnant with their child. She gave birth to twins. Shortly thereafter she left him but took the twins with her. He was heartbroken and I for him. Within a month or so after she left she returned with the children, but only to leave the children with him to raise. She said she was not ready to raise the children. The man was a fisherman by profession. He had numerous fishing containers setup outside his house. They mostly had wood frames made of 4x4 beams. They were around 4 _ feet tall, 7 feet long and 2 or 3 feet wide. The top ledges were only a few inches wide. I took a bike outside and was riding very fast around the ledges of these various containers. They were all full of water. I don't know if they had different kinds of fish in them or what exactly was in them. The man's mother was concerned for me that I was riding a bike around these ledges, especially since I was riding so fast and turning practically on my side as I made some of the corners. I was somewhat frightened and yet surprised at how confident I felt in my ability to do this successfully. The man gave me a net the size you would use in an indoor aquarium and some ziplock bags. He sent me to one of the containers to begin catching fish. I found I was just as successful using my hand as using the net. All of the fish were about the size of aquarium fish but some larger than others. Some seemed impossible to see, either because they were so thin or because of their coloring. I'm not sure which. Others were larger and blue and white in color. I filled one bag. There was a lot of discussion going on between this man and his parents about this woman and the children. At this point the man was my ex-husband, Darren. When the woman returned with the babies we were in the midst of having a yard sale. Each of the containers now had flat tops covering them and we were sitting things for the yard sale on them. I found boxes of jewelry that I had put away because they were related, primarily, to my marriage to my ex-husband. There were a lot of earrings that were bride & groom and such. There were other earrings that I asked Bev if she would allow Mari Kate S to wear. Bev tried to describe what she would want to wear and what she would be allowed to wear. Jody S was also trying to help clarify for me. Mari Kate S finally came out and was looking through them. I picked up a few pairs and pointed them out to Bev and Jody S. They were some of my favorites from the past that I had been saving, hoping they would come back in style. Kay H brought a number of things out that I loved. Some of it was jewelry but others were knick-knacks I was quite surprised that she didn't tell me to just take the things I wanted. After the yard sale was over we were moving everything back into the garage. Kay H and Darren didn't think I knew how to properly care for the twins, so I let them take care of them and I concentrated on organizing the garage. Ray H had a few shelves in the garage with various glass and plastic items sitting on them. I wanted to put all like items together and move the glass items to the sturdiest shelves. In examining the shelves I realized that one was simply made up of a nylon fabric and resembled a kite. It also had hinges so it could be dropped similar to a drop leaf on a drop-leaf table. I realized it was useless for storage. I went to another shelf that was a huge half-circle that protruded far into the room. I was trying to move some of the furniture and things along the walls so I could move around more easily and get to these shelves more easily. In doing so I nearly knocked quite a few of the glass items to the floor. Actually I think I did knock some of them off but don't recall anything breaking. Near this one unusual shelf was also an unusual metal rack on the wall that was being used to hold glasses and such. This rack rested flat against the wall but hinges allowed different sections to be pulled just far enough away from the wall to allow you to slip an upside down stack of glasses on it. There were quite a few pieces, 100 or more, of one type of blue glassware. Some of them were on this wall rack and others were on the large semi-circular shelf. I was going to put them all on the shelf but then realized that shelf would not support all the weight. I was going to put them all on the rack but then Kay H came out and began telling me how to do that as well. Just for fun, someone suggested some kind of contest involving the number of garage sale items we were each working with. An adult was to represent a child. I was representing Rachel S. I would have won except that I did not get my items counted fast enough, primarily because I had so many more than the others. which is, oddly, what it took to win but you had to have them counted in time too. We are back to dealing with and arguing about the care of the twins. The size of the twins kept changing. they weren't even as big as my hand. At another time, one was nearly the normal size of a newborn and the other was less than the size of my hand. Then they were pieces of paper rather than actual babies, but each baby was two pieces of paper rather than just one. There was some discussion about where the twins would sleep and where Darren and I would sleep. Certainly, I had no desire to share a bed with him as the mother of the twins had done and yet somehow that seemed to be critical to the nocturnal care of the twins. The bed was not a normal bed however. It was more like a sofa with a cot in front of it. We each sat on one end of the sofa and stretched our legs out onto the cot. For some reason it was finally decided that I was to leave and take the twins with me. It is unclear to me if I was to take them permanently or if I was taking them on a purposeful journey. I was to take this journey on horseback, alone with the twins. There was a man helping me to prepare the horse, saddling him and putting the things I would need in the saddlebags, etc. I am traveling on a Native American pilgrimage with Matthew. I have the sense that the purpose of this pilgrimage was primarily for Matthew but somewhere along the way I realized that I was and would continue to derive as much if not more from this journey as he would. We had several things that Matthew had to accomplish on this journey. I believe it was to include two nights out in the woods. There were a number of people on the same journey, so we found we were not alone in figuring out what to do or knowing what we needed to do or how to accomplish those things. I was glad to know this. We became very fond of our fellow travelers. I became more in love with Native American Culture than I had even previously been. The people were wonderful and the traditions and rituals were so rich and wonderful. The rituals were wonderful not just because of the ritual itself but because of the transformation Matthew and I, and others, experienced as a result of completing each ritual. there was something that would be beneficial for Matthew to acquire. Oddly, the only way he could acquire it was to purchase it. It was quite expensive and I realized that neither he nor I could, or should, spend that much money on that item. An elderly Native American man sold it to us for what we told him Matthew had in his bank account which was around $16.99. I felt bad because we lied to him. Matthew had nearly $35 in his account, which was the actual price of the item. I didn't want Matthew to be totally broke so I lied to the man about how much money Matthew had. This struck me as particularly odd because I knew I wouldn't normally do this. When Matthew was writing the check to the man, I made sure he kept hidden the total from his check register. There were several scenes in which the entire group was riding horseback to our next destination or ritual. We were told that for one of the rituals Matthew would need to entirely undress. I knew Matthew would be uncomfortable with this but understood the purpose of the ritual and thought it would be very beneficial. I realized how beneficial it would be for me so I participated in the ritual as well. It was incredibly freeing, as though my soul had been freed. It was exhilarating. I became totally hooked on the entire process and future opportunities. When we settled into our campsite for the night we were preparing meals. I was having a little trouble contemplating eating the food that we were expected to eat. I couldn't bring myself to eat the first thing. The next thing they brought was the foot of some very large animal. It still had the fur on it and everything, but it had been cooked. I cut off two toes. I gave one to someone else and then I ate one. I was surprised that it didn't taste too bad. It seems that I was even eating the fur and didn't mind it. In our next ritual we were given some freedom in how we completed it. Given how great it felt to be able to complete the ritual of being completely nude in front of all these strangers I decided that I would remove most of my clothing and due a Native American dance around the campfire. Everyone admired the progress I made and my new level of confidence. I thought about the twins, thinking something like oh, yes. The twins. I pointed them out or said something about them to the others. Later I thought, wait a minute. I started out with the twins. I can't just not have them in the dream anymore. So I remember thinking something about having them in a type of papoose on my back. We are now sitting in another location talking about future similar, but advanced, journeys we can complete. We would do so in a certain order. To progress to each journey we would need to adequately complete the requirements of the prior and be living a certain lifestyle. At this point I am writing notes on a piece of paper about the things I need to do so I can achieve this level and move on to the next journey. Some of the things this included were writing on a more natural kind of paper and wearing different kinds of jewelry. like more things with feathers and such. There was some type of Native American title that went with the completion of this journey. I can't remember now what it was. It started with a T. Tahoe? Tecumseh? I don't know now. While we are at this place there are also containers sitting around for trash and other things. I was trying to get all the trash into the right container, as I knew that was a perfect example of this new lifestyle. At first another woman or two was somewhat deterring me from what I was attempting. They did not see it as that important. Then someone came around to collect the trash and had a momentary conversation with me about it and I realized that I was right. There were also binders and books sitting around. The speaker was talking about various things we could do to complete the various journeys. She mentioned something about Deepak Chopra. I recall seeing other names. There were other rituals but I don't recall what they were now. I went on a short horseback ride with someone else. There was something sexual about this experience. I was trying to help this other person heighten their sexual awareness or be able to get more pleasure from sexual experiences. On our way home I was riding with a man I had just then met.

         "Interpret this dream: I was the housekeeper for a man and his young son, similar to the movie Sleepless in Seattle. I had been working for them for nearly a year when they began the search for a new wife for the man. I was in love with him by this time. They found his new wife and I was experiencing the expected feelings about the entire situation, but I did not end my employment there. I did not feel the marriage would work out and I didn't want the man to feel worse when he found himself without a wife or a housekeeper. Shortly after they married, the wife became pregnant with their child. She gave birth to twins. Shortly thereafter she left him but took the twins with her. He was heartbroken and I for him. Within a month or so after she left she returned with the children, but only to leave the children with him to raise. She said she was not ready to raise the children. The man was a fisherman by profession. He had numerous fishing containers setup outside his house. They mostly had wood frames made of 4x4 beams. They were around 4 _ feet tall, 7 feet long and 2 or 3 feet wide. The top ledges were only a few inches wide. I took a bike outside and was riding very fast around the ledges of these various containers. They were all full of water. I don't know if they had different kinds of fish in them or what exactly was in them. The man's mother was concerned for me that I was riding a bike around these ledges, especially since I was riding so fast and turning practically on my side as I made some of the corners. I was somewhat frightened and yet surprised at how confident I felt in my ability to do this successfully. The man gave me a net the size you would use in an indoor aquarium and some ziplock bags. He sent me to one of the containers to begin catching fish. I found I was just as successful using my hand as using the net. All of the fish were about the size of aquarium fish but some larger than others. Some seemed impossible to see, either because they were so thin or because of their coloring. I'm not sure which. Others were larger and blue and white in color. I filled one bag. There was a lot of discussion going on between this man and his parents about this woman and the children. At this point the man was my ex-husband, Darren. When the woman returned with the babies we were in the midst of having a yard sale. Each of the containers now had flat tops covering them and we were sitting things for the yard sale on them. I found boxes of jewelry that I had put away because they were related, primarily, to my marriage to my ex-husband. There were a lot of earrings that were bride & groom and such. There were other earrings that I asked Bev if she would allow Mari Kate S to wear. Bev tried to describe what she would want to wear and what she would be allowed to wear. Jody S was also trying to help clarify for me. Mari Kate S finally came out and was looking through them. I picked up a few pairs and pointed them out to Bev and Jody S. They were some of my favorites from the past that I had been saving, hoping they would come back in style. Kay H brought a number of things out that I loved. Some of it was jewelry but others were knick-knacks I was quite surprised that she didn't tell me to just take the things I wanted. After the yard sale was over we were moving everything back into the garage. Kay H and Darren didn't think I knew how to properly care for the twins, so I let them take care of them and I concentrated on organizing the garage. Ray H had a few shelves in the garage with various glass and plastic items sitting on them. I wanted to put all like items together and move the glass items to the sturdiest shelves. In examining the shelves I realized that one was simply made up of a nylon fabric and resembled a kite. It also had hinges so it could be dropped similar to a drop leaf on a drop-leaf table. I realized it was useless for storage. I went to another shelf that was a huge half-circle that protruded far into the room. I was trying to move some of the furniture and things along the walls so I could move around more easily and get to these shelves more easily. In doing so I nearly knocked quite a few of the glass items to the floor. Actually I think I did knock some of them off but don't recall anything breaking. Near this one unusual shelf was also an unusual metal rack on the wall that was being used to hold glasses and such. This rack rested flat against the wall but hinges allowed different sections to be pulled just far enough away from the wall to allow you to slip an upside down stack of glasses on it. There were quite a few pieces, 100 or more, of one type of blue glassware. Some of them were on this wall rack and others were on the large semi-circular shelf. I was going to put them all on the shelf but then realized that shelf would not support all the weight. I was going to put them all on the rack but then Kay H came out and began telling me how to do that as well. Just for fun, someone suggested some kind of contest involving the number of garage sale items we were each working with. An adult was to represent a child. I was representing Rachel S. I would have won except that I did not get my items counted fast enough, primarily because I had so many more than the others. which is, oddly, what it took to win but you had to have them counted in time too. We are back to dealing with and arguing about the care of the twins. The size of the twins kept changing. they weren't even as big as my hand. At another time, one was nearly the normal size of a newborn and the other was less than the size of my hand. Then they were pieces of paper rather than actual babies, but each baby was two pieces of paper rather than just one. There was some discussion about where the twins would sleep and where Darren and I would sleep. Certainly, I had no desire to share a bed with him as the mother of the twins had done and yet somehow that seemed to be critical to the nocturnal care of the twins. The bed was not a normal bed however. It was more like a sofa with a cot in front of it. We each sat on one end of the sofa and stretched our legs out onto the cot. For some reason it was finally decided that I was to leave and take the twins with me. It is unclear to me if I was to take them permanently or if I was taking them on a purposeful journey. I was to take this journey on horseback, alone with the twins. There was a man helping me to prepare the horse, saddling him and putting the things I would need in the saddlebags, etc. I am traveling on a Native American pilgrimage with Matthew. I have the sense that the purpose of this pilgrimage was primarily for Matthew but somewhere along the way I realized that I was and would continue to derive as much if not more from this journey as he would. We had several things that Matthew had to accomplish on this journey. I believe it was to include two nights out in the woods. There were a number of people on the same journey, so we found we were not alone in figuring out what to do or knowing what we needed to do or how to accomplish those things. I was glad to know this. We became very fond of our fellow travelers. I became more in love with Native American Culture than I had even previously been. The people were wonderful and the traditions and rituals were so rich and wonderful. The rituals were wonderful not just because of the ritual itself but because of the transformation Matthew and I, and others, experienced as a result of completing each ritual. there was something that would be beneficial for Matthew to acquire. Oddly, the only way he could acquire it was to purchase it. It was quite expensive and I realized that neither he nor I could, or should, spend that much money on that item. An elderly Native American man sold it to us for what we told him Matthew had in his bank account which was around $16.99. I felt bad because we lied to him. Matthew had nearly $35 in his account, which was the actual price of the item. I didn't want Matthew to be totally broke so I lied to the man about how much money Matthew had. This struck me as particularly odd because I knew I wouldn't normally do this. When Matthew was writing the check to the man, I made sure he kept hidden the total from his check register.

         "Most of this nightmare felt like a chase scene from a movie. I was at my birth home spending the night. Bev was a child, maybe six or seven years old. I was in bed doing something on my laptop. I put the laptop away and tried to go to sleep. I couldn't get comfortable so I finally took my clothes off, thinking that no one ever comes in the room or even opens the door without my permission when I'm spending the night there. A few minutes later Bev came and crawled into bed. I decided I would quietly my clothes back on as soon as she fell asleep and in the meantime I would just make sure there were always blankets between us. Something seemed to be wrong but she wouldn't say much. Mother came in the room and gave her what must have been a favorite doll that was wrapped in two blankets. A little while later Mother came in the room with a small bouquet of flowers and gave those to Bev, laying them with her in bed. I thought this was very odd. After Mother left the room I coaxed Bev into talking to me. She wasn't feeling well physically. Mother had given her something and then brought the doll and the flowers in for comfort. I moved the blankets off of bed because of the flowers and realized that mother had wrapped Bev in two plastic bags. The one closest to her was the kind of plastic bag you use for fresh produce at a grocery store, but Bev fit in it completely. There was another plastic bag over the top of it. They were completely stuck to her body because they were making her so hot. I quickly took them off of her for fear of what they would do to her. I became furious with Mother for doing this and wondered why she would do such a thing, especially to Bev. I moved her close to me and just held her close to me and rubbed her back to comfort her. I think I was trying to comfort myself as much as her. I reached over to set my alarm so I wouldn't oversleep in the morning. As I did I hit the sleep button instead of the button to set the time on the alarm. This aggravated me because I didn't want to be listening to music for a half hour. I turned the volume way down and hoped I would remember to turn it back up in a half hour. Other members of the family showed up and came into the room. Mother and Daddy stayed in their bedroom the whole time. We began talking about some of the things they had done to all of us over the years. A few decided that it was time to confront them and then walk away. I asked Bev if she would want to come and live with me and she said yes. I didn't want to leave her there after that. Then Todd A came and sat next to her and she cuddled up to him. I asked her if she would rather live with me or be wherever Todd A was and she said with Todd A. I was surprised and hurt but did my best not to show it. Bob F had each of us write a note to Mother and Daddy on small note cards. I didn't want to do it. I was concerned about what this would do to Daddy, since he is the more fragile of the two, both emotionally and physically. I finally wrote something but I didn't even know how to begin to put into words what I felt, especially on this little card. I don't think what I wrote was even close to accurate. It was more of something just to appease my siblings. After everyone was done writing their notes Bob F took them to their bedroom, gave them to them, and then returned to my room. I told Bev she needed to pack a few things right away. We were all just going to leave. Bev kept getting distracted and I kept trying to get her focused on getting some things together so we could leave. We were all going to leave together so no one person was left alone to possibly face them. Before we could leave they walked into my bedroom. It's a small room so it seemed like wall-to-wall people. There was just barely room for them to step inside the door. I don't remember much of the conversation except that they tried to address a few of us individually about what we had written on the card. When they got to me, I mostly told them that they could never accept me for who I am and what I want to do with my life. They responded and as tears came to my eyes my voice cracked as I told them I've never been able to just be myself around them and we've never been able to talk to them. Mother walked out of the room for a couple of minutes and then returned with what appeared to be a six or so medicine tablets in her hand. She began to tell me how she had found these laying here and there when I was still living at home, before I got married. I looked at the small white, round pills and asked what they were. Daddy asked me what they looked like. I just looked up at him and then at Mother and knew immediately that they were birth control pills. Mother looked at me with the same disgust that had become familiar to me so many years ago. I got angry and asked her why she would save them, especially all of these years. Before she had a chance to answer I asked her if it made her angry because I didn't talk to her first like Bev did. I reminded her that she suggested that Bev move in with her fianc_e before she got married. At least I didn't do that. They both turned and walked out of the run and we all left. I kept Bev close to me because I knew this would be most upsetting to her. I thought she and I were going to get in BJ's car but then Brian F told me that BJ was riding with her and there was room for us in his car because it was some unusual kind of car with three rows of seats. As Bev and I got in the middle seat I saw the third row of seats behind us. Now we were trying to get away without someone catching us. We seemed to be on the high school property. There were quite a few buildings and there were cement steps what seemed to be about every hundred feet or so. They were very close together. Each time we came to a set of steps there were three flights. The first flight went one direction, the next flight went in the opposite direction, and the third flight in the same direction as the first. Brian F backed down the flights of steps in his car. He went so fast that I was frightened but he did it so cleanly that I realized he had done this more than once before. As is typical for him, he was laughing as he did it. Sometimes he took these hills that were as steep down and then immediately up again just like a roller coaster. Bev and I neither one liked it at all and I told him so. He said it was necessary. I didn't recognize or know a few of the people with us. They were friends of some of the family members. We had to stop for a little while for some reason. One of the females with us that I didn't know decided she was going to use the restroom while we were stopped. The restroom was not enclosed along the front. It was a long row of stalls with doors, but no walls. It was night time so you couldn't see much. If I strained my eyes I could see her feet under the stall door. It was a coed restroom. She took so long we kept asking her if she was okay or if she was about ready to go. She finally came out and now we had to wait for someone else. I decided to use the restroom very quickly before we left again. Six or eight other family members followed me. Now there were no walls to the stalls. It was just three long rows of toilets out in the open. I was very embarrassed and didn't like this when the other family members came in but none of them seemed to mind. An employee was standing there waiting for us to leave so she could close up for the night. I quickly got up and walked away. After everyone else was back in the cars I went back to the restroom hoping to use it in private but the woman had replaced all of the toilets with tan plastic chairs. We were no longer in cars. We were in something that reminds me of the cars of a roller coaster at an amusement park, except that each car could only seat one person and the person in front actually drove it. There were several of these though, with several members of the family in each. The first couple of times that we got out and back in I put Bev in the seat with me even though the seat was only made to hold one person. I had her wear the seatbelt. The last two times we got out and back in Bev wanted to sit alone in the very back seat. I said okay, but frequently turned around to check on her. We were now traveling on rails that looked somewhat like roller coaster tracks, except the look of what was on the bottom of them changed frequently. There were three or four different looks in all. The track was barely wider than the width of an adult. Some times we traveled on them much faster than others. People who worked on this property knew we were there and were chasing us. Peggy F and some of Bob F's boys were with us. Mari Kate S was with us and was car sick. She was sitting right behind me. Nothing I suggested to her helped her. Now the car that I was in was being driven by someone I didn't know. He stopped the car long enough to put a plastic tub next to her in case she became too ill. We got split up. They started pointing guns at us. Brian F pulled out a gun, shot, and killed one of the men. I was horrified and even more concerned about what this was all doing to Bev. The others let us think we were all getting away and then I suddenly saw a series of explosions on a track a little distance from us. I could only watch as I realized that members of my family were being killed one-by-one. I was too upset to even scream or cry. I was trying to think who might have been in that car. I got out and began running with Bev. I thought we were getting away. As we kept running, down steps, sliding down some cement tracks, etc., other family members would see us and join us. We got to a place that looked like a bit of a maze and we saw a guard with a flashlight approaching. We all crouched down as far as we could hoping not to be detected. I was covering Bev. The guard was practically right next to us, shining the flashlight around looking at various things. Sometimes the beam of her flashlight just barely missed us. Bev was now an adult and was sitting further behind me. She had on a dangling bracelet that kept making noise. I heard others behind me giggling. I was getting very upset. The guard was going to hear this. She did and shined her flashlight on us. All of the women in our group offered to give her all of our jewelry if she would just let us go. She agreed. We got to a grassy hill. All we had to do was climb the hill, get through a wire fence and cross the road on the other side of the fence. Then we could disappear into the wooded area there. Actually, I was thinking that once we were off of their property they couldn't do anything, but I didn't want to take any chances. I wanted to get into the woods so they couldn't spot us. Bev was small again now. I raced across the road with her and some other family members followed me. Someone thought we should stay visible to try to get the attention of any of the others if we saw them. I thought one person could be the lookout for the others without being seen, only to stand out and get their attention if they saw them. It would minimize the risk. At the end I wondered if everyone was actually okay, that maybe someone else had been killed in the explosions. [I didn't record all of this because I don't want to.]",

Bev kept getting distracted and I kept trying to get her focused on getting some things together so we could leave. We were all going to leave together so no one person was left alone to possibly face them. Before we could leave they walked into my bedroom. It's a small room so it seemed like wall-to-wall people. There was just barely room for them to step inside the door. I don't remember much of the conversation except that they tried to address a few of us individually about what we had written on the card. When they got to me, I mostly told them that they could never accept me for who I am and what I want to do with my life. They responded and as tears came to my eyes my voice cracked as I told them I've never been able to just be myself around them and we've never been able to talk to them. Mother walked out of the room for a couple of minutes and then returned with what appeared to be a six or so medicine tablets in her hand. She began to tell me how she had found these laying here and there when I was still living at home, before I got married. I looked at the small white, round pills and asked what they were. Daddy asked me what they looked like. I just looked up at him and then at Mother and knew immediately that they were birth control pills. Mother looked at me with the same disgust that had become familiar to me so many years ago. I got angry and asked her why she would save them, especially all of these years. Before she had a chance to answer I asked her if it made her angry because I didn't talk to her first like Bev did. I reminded her that she suggested that Bev move in with her fianc_e before she got married. At least I didn't do that. They both turned and walked out of the run and we all left. I kept Bev close to me because I knew this would be most upsetting to her. I thought she and I were going to get in BJ's car but then Brian F told me that BJ was riding with her and there was room for us in his car because it was some unusual kind of car with three rows of seats. As Bev and I got in the middle seat I saw the third row of seats behind us. Now we were trying to get away without someone catching us. We seemed to be on the high school property. There were quite a few buildings and there were cement steps what seemed to be about every hundred feet or so. They were very close together. Each time we came to a set of steps there were three flights. The first flight went one direction, the next flight went in the opposite direction, and the third flight in the same direction as the first. Brian F backed down the flights of steps in his car. He went so fast that I was frightened but he did it so cleanly that I realized he had done this more than once before. As is typical for him, he was laughing as he did it. Sometimes he took these hills that were as steep down and then immediately up again just like a roller coaster. Bev and I neither one liked it at all and I told him so. He said it was necessary. I didn't recognize or know a few of the people with us. They were friends of some of the family members. We had to stop for a little while for some reason. One of the females with us that I didn't know decided she was going to use the restroom while we were stopped. The restroom was not enclosed along the front. It was a long row of stalls with doors, but no walls. It was night time so you couldn't see much. If I strained my eyes I could see her feet under the stall door. It was a coed restroom. She took so long we kept asking her if she was okay or if she was about ready to go. She finally came out and now we had to wait for someone else. I decided to use the restroom very quickly before we left again. Six or eight other family members followed me. Now there were no walls to the stalls. It was just three long rows of toilets out in the open. I was very embarrassed and didn't like this when the other family members came in but none of them seemed to mind. An employee was standing there waiting for us to leave so she could close up for the night. I quickly got up and walked away. After everyone else was back in the cars I went back to the restroom hoping to use it in private but the woman had replaced all of the toilets with tan plastic chairs. We were no longer in cars. We were in something that reminds me of the cars of a roller coaster at an amusement park, except that each car could only seat one person and the person in front actually drove it. There were several of these though, with several members of the family in each. The first couple of times that we got out and back in I put Bev in the seat with me even though the seat was only made to hold one person. I had her wear the seatbelt. The last two times we got out and back in Bev wanted to sit alone in the very back seat. I said okay, but frequently turned around to check on her. We were now traveling on rails that looked somewhat like roller coaster tracks, except the look of what was on the bottom of them changed frequently. There were three or four different looks in all. The track was barely wider than the width of an adult. Some times we traveled on them much faster than others. People who worked on this property knew we were there and were chasing us. Peggy F and some of Bob F's boys were with us. Mari Kate S was with us and was car sick. She was sitting right behind me. Nothing I suggested to her helped her. Now the car that I was in was being driven by someone I didn't know. He stopped the car long enough to put a plastic tub next to her in case she became too ill. We got split up. They started pointing guns at us. Brian F pulled out a gun, shot, and killed one of the men. I was horrified and even more concerned about what this was all doing to Bev. The others let us think we were all getting away and then I suddenly saw a series of explosions on a track a little distance from us. I could only watch as I realized that members of my family were being killed one-by-one. I was too upset to even scream or cry. I was trying to think who might have been in that car. I got out and began running with Bev. I thought we were getting away. As we kept running, down steps, sliding down some cement tracks, etc., other family members would see us and join us. We got to a place that looked like a bit of a maze and we saw a guard with a flashlight approaching. We all crouched down as far as we could hoping not to be detected. I was covering Bev. The guard was practically right next to us, shining the flashlight around looking at various things. Sometimes the beam of her flashlight just barely missed us. Bev was now an adult and was sitting further behind me. She had on a dangling bracelet that kept making noise. I heard others behind me giggling. I was getting very upset. The guard was going to hear this. She did and shined her flashlight on us. All of the women in our group offered to give her all of our jewelry if she would just let us go. She agreed. We got to a grassy hill. All we had to do was climb the hill, get through a wire fence and cross the road on the other side of the fence. Then we could disappear into the wooded area there. Actually, I was thinking that once we were off of their property they couldn't do anything, but I didn't want to take any chances. I wanted to get into the woods so they couldn't spot us. Bev was small again now. I raced across the road with her and some other family members followed me. Someone thought we should stay visible to try to get the attention of any of the others if we saw them. I thought one person could be the lookout for the others without being seen, only to stand out and get their attention if they saw them. It would minimize the risk. At the end I wondered if everyone was actually okay, that maybe someone else had been killed in the explosions.

         "I went for my informational interview with Jeff S. After we finished talking he said he was going out for a cup of coffee and asked if I would like to join him. Because I felt this could be an important future business contact I agreed. As we walked down the street, he said he had this special little place that he likes to go. By the looks of the outside of this place I had not even realized it when we arrived there. The entry was dark but there were three white steps leading up to the door. To the left the wall jutted out as far as the bottom step as did the overhead. Now we are in a mini-van type vehicle. Jeff S is driving and I'm sitting in the front passenger sit. There are two people in the back seat. In the seat directly behind me is Jennifer K. I don't know now who the other is. I am turned sideways in my seat, with my legs and feet resting between my seat and Jeff S's. I am talking to the two people in back, but primarily to Jennifer K. Somebody says something that unnerves me. Without thinking I lifted my right hand as if to grab something for support or stability. Jeff S takes my hand. He does so just partially, and cautiously. But I had the sense that this concerned me more than him. I didn't want to give him the wrong impression or do anything inappropriate. It was at this point that I realized he was a single dad. Sometime during all of this we talked about his children, who seemed to be all boys. Something caused me to let go of his hand. I reached to take it again but this time he was holding his hand sideways with his fingers spread apart and my fingers seemed to just naturally go between his. It wasn't until after I did it that I realized what I had done and again felt a bit concerned about impression or inappropriate action. But he just tightened his fingers around mine, just a little, confirming that this was okay. During all of this he never took his eyes off the road, but I don't think I ever looked directly at his face either. I had now let go of his hand as we continued to wherever we were going. I was wearing a skirt that came just above my knees when I sat. As I was talking to the people in back I felt Jeff S's hand slide gently between my knees and lightly caress the inner part of my right knee and just slightly above. Of course I noticed immediately and wasn't sure what to think. He did two or three other similar things, always very subtle, yet noticeable. I reminded myself that he is single and thought that perhaps there was some romantic interest. I thought how nice it would be to be in a relationship with a man like Jeff S. Now Jeff S and I are in this place having coffee and Jennifer K is with us. I don't know what happened to the other person. The weather outside was such that we had coats on, but not necessarily winter coats. It was raining and beginning to get dark. I got the impression that because Jennifer K was with us Jeff S didn't feel he could leave when he wanted. I didn't know if I should say anything to him, to let him know it was fine for him to leave. I had a tote bag with me, with my handbag, portfolio, etc in it. I was looking around for their restrooms. I got the attention of a woman who worked there and she said take me there. She had very pretty, black, shoulder-length hair with lots of volume and wavy curls. I am outside the restroom with Jennifer K. I went in cautiously because there wasn't a full door. The door was more like a stall door in a public restroom, except that it didn't go nearly as high. So passersby could see who was in there. Jennifer K knew I was very uncomfortable with this but had decided I just couldn't wait any longer so she stood in front of the door, facing me, and talking. I noticed a man standing behind her waiting for me to finish. I became concerned, wondering if I was using the men's room or if it was a coed restroom. I did notice a urinal on the wall. As I left I heard a family talking at a nearby table. They were talking about a tote bag that the little boy found and that it was so comfortable. I realized that he had picked mine up and taken it to his table. He had set a stuffed animal on top of it. I just casually went over and picked up my tote and walked away without saying anything. I heard someone at their table tell him that he didn't get to keep it and I somehow knew that the little boy was disappointed. As I returned to the table it occurred to me that possibly Jeff S was hoping Jennifer K would leave so he could talk with me alone again. I suppose he finally gave up and said he needed to get home to his children. He got up from the table and hesitated for a moment then left. A little while later he returned. I don't know if he said told me this or I implied it, but that his children were all tucked in bed for the night so he could leave again. Now I'm in the van with just Jeff S. As we are driving he is expressing his romantic interest in me. He said he wanted very much to kiss me. I was flattered, intrigued, yet wasn't sure how to respond so I simply smiled and said nothing. Later he says the same thing again. Now we are back at the place we were and Jennifer K is there, again or still. There are a bunch of things that we need to load in the back of the van. The van is now Jennifer K 's and it is pretty full of her family's things but we find room for what we need to put in there. The back of the van, from the outside, looks more like an SUV. But from the side it looks like a van. There are several food-serving dishes sitting in the back, with no lids yet partially consumed food in them. I found this curious but said nothing. Jennifer K and Jeff S are both leaving now but Jennifer K is leaving the van for me to drive home. She gave me the keys and said something about the van - like it being temperamental or some such. I tossed the keys in my tote and went back inside alone. I thought I had misplaced the keys once or twice. The place was getting ready to close for the night. I was standing near a back corner that was not well lit. There was a man standing 20 feet or so behind me. Jeff S walks back in and comes straight towards me. He stops just a few feet in front of me. He doesn't say anything, but suddenly leans forward and kisses me. After I got past the surprise of him showing up, and then doing this, I was thinking that he was a really bad kisser. He kept his lips tight together and pursed like a pucker. This was very disappointing. I was trying to make it better but not being successful. He stopped for a moment, said something, and then kissed me again. This time with open mouth. It was a little better, but still not great. He turns and leaves. I am now with him again, and I think there are other people around. We're having a good time, talking and laughing. I notice that his voice is different than I recall. It's not the deep and strong voice I was used to hearing from him. I thought maybe he had a cold. Then I noticed that his teeth, particularly the upper ones, were in very bad condition. The ones that were still there were very irregular, and some very dark. Really bad teeth are always a real turn-off to me. I felt guilty about this because I know it is very superficial. Yet, I have trouble wanting to kiss someone with really bad teeth. I either guessed or he told me that he is the midst of having some significant dental work done and his teeth look like they do because they are in the middle of the process. This made me feel better about thinking about being in a romantic relationship with him, yet I still felt bad because of my attitude towards this. Now I am alone again in the restaurant. All of the other patrons have left and there are two employees still there, closing up. Apparently there had been some kind of spill when Jeff S was there earlier and we had used a towel he had with him to clean it up. Jeff S called my cell phone to tell me it had been left at the restaurant, but it was very important that he get it back. He was guessing that it had been thrown in the trash. He said it had some important information on it. When I got off the phone I asked one of the employees about it. She took me to the back to where the trashcan was. It was a small office-sized wastebasket. Right on top there was a white towel that appeared to have spaghetti sauce all over it, or something like it. I gingerly picked it up so as not to get anything on me. Moving it around with my hand I looked at it to see if it was the right one. I told the employee that it wasn't. Then I noticed another one in the wastebasket. Again, a white towel with something that looked like spaghetti sauce all over it. As I bent down to pick it up I noticed the row after row of typed information on it. I said that this is the one. I picked it up and turned to leave. I went outside to the van. I seemed to behind the building, with the back of another building across the parking lot. There were only one or two other cars in the parking lot, and the van was parked furthest away. I was a bit nervous about walking alone to the van at this time of night. When I got to the van I realized that it had been broken into and someone had stolen some of the things that we had put in it earlier. That bothered me of course, but I was most bothered because Jennifer K had lent me her van and now some of her family things had been taken as well. I thought it was odd that they had taken some of the food-serving dishes. The two employees came out of the door Jeff S and I had entered originally. One came down the steps while the other locked the door. Then she same down the steps. She saw me by the van and said something to me. I told her about the things being stolen. As we talked another woman walked up. She was a maintenance worker of some kind. She said she threw the things away because she thought they were supposed to be. I was very upset yet trying not to show it, as I didn't want to hurt or upset her if it was an honest mistake. I quickly started looking around, thinking I could just retrieve the things from the trash. I asked where she had disposed of them. She pointed towards the building and said she had thrown them over there, in the river. Now I was simply flabbergasted. I was thinking, what? Why would she do that? Why would she dispose of things she thought was trash in a river? However, while I was thinking this I was looking towards where she was pointing and not seeing a river by any means. I thought that was crazy. There wouldn't be a river running alongside a building, and there wasn't enough room between these two buildings for there to be a river anyway. As I squinted and tried to focus my eyes to see better in the darkness, I noticed a small gully cut into the cement along the building. Water was flowing out of an opening through this gully. The gully went 20 - 30 feet or so and then there was a sharp right angle and it continued. I think a little further down there was a sharp left angle where it continued. As soon as I noticed it I ran over there hoping that I might be able to retrieve the things. I saw nothing and realized it had been too long since she disposed of it and it had all been washed away.",

         "This dream, as I recall it, begins earlier, but I remember it begins at a very elite party, very uppercrust, and for what reason, I have no idea, but I'm there. I believe everyone is dressed in tuxedos and evening gowns, and the instant that I clearly remember began when a most complex piece of design that was decorating the place is some way centrally involved with the activity of the evening, made out of cardboard or silvered (antepaper?) became disarrayed, and I think it was supposed to be my fault or something, but at any rate, I attempted to strike it out. The next thing I remember I was in a hallway and two women were helping me straighten it out, either one was on an end of it and that made them approximately 12 ft. away from one another, and I was underneath trying to straighten this rather complex design. I would sort of crawl on the floor from one to the other, trying to straighten it out because it seemed to be the only way. I became somewhat enamoured with one of the women, even though both of their skirts were rather tight around their knees, the one that I thought was also slightly interested in me, I may have kissed her on the calf and I believe she liked it and sort of presented her other calf to be kissed, which I think I did. Then just out of sheer devilishness, I crept back, fixing the design and kissed the other one on the calf, which didn't go over too big. As a matter of fact, I was quite certain that she was shocked and was possibly indignant about it, but I just chuckled to myself and continued about my work. The rather curvaceous and attractive woman at the other end was moving about and I caressed her legs again and put my hands on and then finally I think I got this complex design straightened out. Then I had taken it in my hands away from the ladies and there were finger holes up and down the center of it, from one end to the other, so that grabbed a certain way, it would open up into a certain kind of a design. I just grabbed and pulled it a certain way, but then the other woman who became indignant at my behavior said, \"I'm going to inform my husband about this, \" and the other woman and I, looking at one another sort of laughingly, and I said to her, mocking the behavior of the indignant woman, \"But c'estime moi?\" and she corrected it and said, \"No, it's not _____, it's (certain moi)\" or something like that. At any rate, she corrected my pronunciation smilingly. It was a rather inviting smile. She was very -- well, they were both projecting a very sensual interest in one another. As we continued to walk down this corridor, we came into a living room, sort of, and this woman was walking back, the indignant one, and the lady who I was with separated from me for a moment, and the indignant woman informed me that she had informed her husband of the unpleasant incident. Well, her husband didn't know me by looking at me. She just informed him of my name and at any rate as I walked by her, I realized her husband was an old man and he was sitting with a rather matronly woman. Now the picture becomes rather complicated. I happened to overhear his conversation with this woman and he is expressing to her that he, in very subtle ways, that he admires her, her attractiveness, and the conversation goes on in this vein. And she asks him, \"What about your wife?\" and he makes some kind of comment, I don't know, something like, \"country widow,\" something like this, somehow implying that she's not with him and she's not anywhere around. She's in the country, or something like this. I think that was the phrase he used, something like golf widow, but he didn't use that phrase. By some deceptive scheme, I had prearranged it so that his wife was there. I don't know where I did this. It's not yet completely clear. It involved a friend of mine, whom I believe I somehow manipulated to appear as myself. A funny thing took place with the conversation of all of us, was in a very British accent. It was almost like a comedy of Shaw, although I dare say my dreams are not quite that good. At any rate, well, this other woman with whom I was rather beginning to become enamoured and interested, I gave her a pat on the rear end and said, \"Now you take this tray of glasses and go in there and offer so and so a drink or something,\" and some way this was a feint, a manner of throwing this man's wife off guard, thinking that somehow things weren't as she thought. It was very complicated. I can't quite figure it out. At any rate, the upshot of the whole thing was that his wife observed him in this rather intimate conversation with the woman he was sitting next to. In other words, the old fat fuddy duddy he was, he was making a play for her and this struck myself and my new-found friend rather amusingly and we both had chuckled to ourselves as the man's wife stomped off in another direction, again rather indignantly. In the earlier part of this dream, there was something taking place in an auditorium, I believe, and it's just that I don't remember too much about the design, but as I say, it was extremely intricate. It was longitudinal and it had at one time been a solid piece of material which had been extremely carefully cut so that it opened into a very complex design, very symmetrical, and as I said, there were these finger holes down the left of it so that by placing one's finger in them, they're labeled which finger went where on the back of it, and how it was to be pulled so that the design came out. At the time it seemed like to get this design back together was a very crucial thing to the affair that was going on. Although in what way, I really am not sure. I had the feeling that self, well, that I was playing a role almost like an actor, and everything was going off according to the cue and the performance was just perfect. The whole dream had a tone of being a very farcical comedy in the old traditions, so to speak, a British comedy, with as I said, sexual overtones. I was just delighted with the whole thing. The old man whose wife I had infuriated was sitting at a very large, dark mahogany table with this woman whom he was making a play for, who was wearing a very low cut evening gown. She was rather fat, though, I won't say, well yes, sort of heavy and so was he. They both were stereotype sort of characters. He a fat old man, rich with a bald head and white hair, and he had a self-delusive quality of __________ as he was making it, so to speak, with this woman. She was something like the grande dame, completely bejeweled. Her rather large breasts were apparent at the top of the evening gown. I don't recall much conversation on her part. I got the impression that she was enjoying the whole thing, whereas the man's wife whose calf I kissed was really an attractive woman, but was somewhat, well, her attitude toward herself was that of an older woman. She dressed in a very severe and what I would say moralistic way, her makeup and her hair drawn back packed tightly into a bun, black dress. The women who I really dug was quite curvaceous and radiated sensual warmth toward me. This friend of mine in the earlier part of the dream was, that is the one that was serving as a dupe for me to get out of this fix I was in with this woman's husband, the one I instructed my new-found friend to go in with this tray of glasses and offer him a drink, that was a tray of cocktails or something and at the same time embraced him so as to indicate seemingly, yes, that's right, that she was completely interested in him and somehow thereby indicating that I was interested in this man's wife, that is the wife whom I had insulted. This was done in such a manner that this woman's husband would observe my friend, my male and female friends. It seems that at one point, before we got into the hallway with this fancy design to be straightened out, it was somehow carried up to the back of the auditorium, that is the entrance to it, the top of one of the aisles was a group of people there trying to straighten it out. And I was more or less trying to straighten it out too, and everyone was yelling at everybody else, \"Here's how to do it. This is the way to do it.\" Everybody was trying to fix it at once. Apparently _____________ it had gotten dragged off into this hallway, I'm not sure how. I keep referring to this thing. It's really not that big and yet it seemingly has changed dimensions a couple of times. It's a very heavy paper like that you would find on milk cartons. The one side of it is silver, a cover with aluminum foil. The edges are scalloped, very small scallops. The nature of the design is reminiscent of the top of the, no, it's like a design I've seen upon occasion in this little window. It's done just the same way. The whole design is made out of one piece of paper, but when you collapse it, you can see by the way it was carefully cut, it can open up into this design. Day residue: This design reminds me of the top of the box of popcorn which the article appeared in its own aluminum box, and all you have to do is put on heat on the stove and it will pop. But the top of it is wrapped in such a way that it forms a design and as it pops, it unfolds and billows out. It's a design sort of thing, and the color is aluminum. The female which I became interested in is somewhat reminiscent of a girl I once knew by name practically, had seen her only once, but who later thorough a series of unusual circumstances, came to be a bunny at the Playboy Club, and she is very curvaceous and attractive, though she is not possessed of the more benign sort of personality that the woman in the dream had. I do plan on going to the Playboy Club this evening, and as a matter of fact, the place in which I intend to go there is the living room. One of the big scenes in this dream took place in what appeared to be a living room, having several levels to it, small levels, 3 steps up to one. The idea of an auditorium might also be associated with the Playboy Club since they have many rooms in which they have entertainment of all sorts and present it in all different ways. One particularly sensual element in the dream, I just remembered, was when these women were holding the design, and I was underneath trying to straighten it out, the woman I liked moved around to the side -- this is after I kissed her on the leg -- and she spread her legs apart, not very far because her skirt was tight, but she knew I was right there. It didn't really strike me at all as a gross gesture. It rather warmed me all the more. One additional bit of day residue is that one occasion Gilda and I, how we did I don't know, but for some reason we started talking to one another in a phony British accent and we were kidding one another with this, and this seemed to come in very big in this dream.",

         "I'm coming up to a sort of rocky ledge with a low (natural?) wall - all around there's sky, huge and beautiful. There's a mountain range in the distance. The colors are all yellowish and there's a sort of early-morning feel. It's not warm, but it's not real cold either. Somehow I know this either is Tibet, or we're coming to it. Down beneath the wall are a couple of flowers growing. They're very sturdy, thick-leafed, the kind of petals that start out green first, and shaped something like hyacinths. I think I'll eat one but I see it isn't fully developed yet. There's another, though, with a wider shape to it and quite thick (you might say meaty) rather than made up of lightweight petals, and I pull that and take bites of it. As I do (it doesn't really have much taste, by the way, but it's substantial) I find that buried in it is a small saucerlike bit of pottery, standard white-glazed with a flower pattern round the edge, much like diner dishes - I pull it out and see that it's the foot of a sort of vase or stemmed dish we'd found around here shortly before and we'd wondered where the foot was. It seems that the flower just grew around it. We go on. Soon we get to civilization of a sort. We're in a stairwell of a building I can tell is massive, and the scene is mostly dark, as if it were night, and we were seeing outside through windows, but we're not - on the left (facing down the stairwell) is a huge wall, and it shows a magnificent scene [although right now I can't remember what of, or even what it looked like - it may have even been an outdoor landscape, as if there were a window there. I halfway think the wall in front, on the stairwell, was indeed a window. But I'm not sure.] To the right is an open door into a lighted room, and people - not in large numbers - keep moving up and down the stairs and into and out of the room. They're all Orientals, these people, dressed in native clothes, the long coats, the hats with round stand-up brims, the slipper shoes. I'm aware that this place is equivalent in some respects to a shopping mall - of course, plain and simple, it is one, it has lots of vendors selling things that people want and need, all under one roof; but there's some fundamental difference in it, too. These people are taking the thing more seriously, for one thing. And it isn't set up intentionally for fun - though there are some neat things about it. The left-hand wall, for instance: at first I thought I was looking at (something, whatever it was!) really magnificent and elaborate. But now something has shifted - either it's done this on purpose, or my viewpoint has changed, but I see now that the whole thing is painted, an illusion. A bloody good illusion, but nevertheless not what I thought it was. Now that I know that, it bothers me - the whole situation bothers me. I'm not sure what to do next. At the same time, what's occupying my mind is the observation of this \"shopping-mall\" business. The idea of the mall is sort of \"new\" to us here, but when you think about it, there's nothing unusual about it except that we started building malls in places where there were already plenty of stores to be found. Elsewhere, stores are still grouped collectively for the convenience of the shoppers, but they have to come from farther away and do more business at a time. That's why there were fairs and street markets. It wouldn't be any sillier to build a regular mall in Tibet than in Texas, for heaven's sake. If people want to buy things, why wouldn't they do it in a mall just as easily as from rickety booths on the street? I'm on a city bus with several people from yoga class - I guess we've just left a class - including George and maybe Cynthia. I've got my purse and something else with me, which I stow on the seat. This is [another] \"funny\" bus - has its seats placed differently from regular buses, and it's up high like the out-of-town-coaches. We're all in a pretty fun mood, and we bowl along through a pretty part of town, with big trees and nice streets, older houses and occasional stores and offices. At one point the bus is diverted by road works from its regular route, and we turn to the left. Then, because of the diversion, we have to drive through a building - actually it's a lot like the Central area Pharmacy except it's got a garage attached. There's 2 sections to it. You can pull in the front or the back - the front is a bit more finished, with matching red brick to the store - you can enter the store from there. The back is different, with painted walls, a little more garage-like. The bus stops in the front; it's going to wait there to catch up to its schedule, and we all pile out of it to stretch our legs and look around. This is a place we know anyway, but it's neat. There's a sort of art exhibit in the back section, various things stuck up on the wall as if a children's school class had done them. Sue S is here (suddenly - I don't remember her being on the bus) and she's looking at them with us. And Tree is here, too - this place is only a short distance from where I live - on the street in back, matter of fact - and he's been exploring down here, I guess. He's come in the back door (both are open), and I pick him up and show him to the people. Actually I'm surprised he's letting me do that, and I'm keeping a good strong grip because he's beginning to get twitchy - but Sue and some others say, oh, what a pretty kitty, and I make up my mind to just go on home with him from here since we're so close, without waiting for the bus. I have to go back in to get my stuff, though. [And I suppose I put Tree down because he wasn't with me for the next part.] I climb up and go to get my purse and things, but while I'm here the bus starts to move. I guess it must have been left in gear or something because it starts going right on out and across the street (the entrance faces another street), and carries on for a couple of blocks. It stops eventually because it runs up against something, I guess, but it's a bit precarious. I can see that the street is going a bit downhill and if it starts to roll again it'll be hard to stop. I get out very carefully and go around to the front, thinking I might push it backward off of the incline, if I can (it's not such a big bus at the moment, you see - it seems like a possibility). But it's just barely starting to move again, and I give it a push, but no go - oh dear. I leap out of the way and remember I still haven't got my things, so I jump back on. The bus gathers momentum and rolls onward, down a street and around a curve and finally comes to rest somewhere, no particular damage done. I am joined now by a little guy in a rather exotic outfit - he's not quite midget-sized, but definitely well below average. (Rather good-looking though - dressed up sort of like, you might say, a warrior-elf. Maybe that's what he is. He's got on some sort of blue loincloth affair, and boots - dark hair, not too long - looks tough but still cute.) (I don't know where he comes from, but I'm not shocked to find him there - maybe he was hiding inside or something - I'm sure he didn't come in from outside.) We discuss the situation, which is more involved than it looks - we need to contact somebody for help. We can't handle this bus on our own (it's become something more like a spaceship now, and much larger), we know there's normally a crew of 2 men to run it, and we can't just leave it where it is and go. (I don't know why.) We poke around some, and find the radio to call the central-whatever with, and send a message to send help. That done, we banter around some more - this all seems like a rather fun adventure - and sort of get cozy. He proposes having sex, right there in the cabin, and I think it sounds like something of a lark, and say yes - I've never had sex with an elf before, for sure, and it might be very different, who knows? We've got nothing better to do till the rescue party gets here, although we don't know when that'll be. [Actually a fair amount of time has passed already.] Suddenly, as he moves over me lying on the floor, he gets bigger - much bigger. He sort of stretches out till he looms over me, and I don't like it. I say so, and next he reaches beyond me over my head to a shelf where he's put something to be handy. It's a kind of face-mask, only it's made of beads (not fine little round beads but cylindrical mostly, they're white and red, maybe orange and yellow too) and it fits over his chin loosely, like a beard.

Is he hiding? Oh, well, I'll just wait.",

         "Interpret this dream: I'm coming up to a sort of rocky ledge with a low (natural?) wall - all around there's sky, huge and beautiful. There's a mountain range in the distance. The colors are all yellowish and there's a sort of early-morning feel. It's not warm, but it's not real cold either. Somehow I know this either is Tibet, or we're coming to it. Down beneath the wall are a couple of flowers growing. They're very sturdy, thick-leafed, the kind of petals that start out green first, and shaped something like hyacinths. I think I'll eat one but I see it isn't fully developed yet. There's another, though, with a wider shape to it and quite thick (you might say meaty) rather than made up of lightweight petals, and I pull that and take bites of it. As I do (it doesn't really have much taste, by the way, but it's substantial) I find that buried in it is a small saucerlike bit of pottery, standard white-glazed with a flower pattern round the edge, much like diner dishes - I pull it out and see that it's the foot of a sort of vase or stemmed dish we'd found around here shortly before and we'd wondered where the foot was. It seems that the flower just grew around it. We go on. Soon we get to civilization of a sort. We're in a stairwell of a building I can tell is massive, and the scene is mostly dark, as if it were night, and we were seeing outside through windows, but we're not - on the left (facing down the stairwell) is a huge wall, and it shows a magnificent scene [although right now I can't remember what of, or even what it looked like - it may have even been an outdoor landscape, as if there were a window there. I halfway think the wall in front, on the stairwell, was indeed a window. But I'm not sure.] To the right is an open door into a lighted room, and people - not in large numbers - keep moving up and down the stairs and into and out of the room. They're all Orientals, these people, dressed in native clothes, the long coats, the hats with round stand-up brims, the slipper shoes. I'm aware that this place is equivalent in some respects to a shopping mall - of course, plain and simple, it is one, it has lots of vendors selling things that people want and need, all under one roof; but there's some fundamental difference in it, too. These people are taking the thing more seriously, for one thing. And it isn't set up intentionally for fun - though there are some neat things about it. The left-hand wall, for instance: at first I thought I was looking at (something, whatever it was!) really magnificent and elaborate. But now something has shifted - either it's done this on purpose, or my viewpoint has changed, but I see now that the whole thing is painted, an illusion. A bloody good illusion, but nevertheless not what I thought it was. Now that I know that, it bothers me - the whole situation bothers me. I'm not sure what to do next. At the same time, what's occupying my mind is the observation of this \"shopping-mall\" business. The idea of the mall is sort of \"new\" to us here, but when you think about it, there's nothing unusual about it except that we started building malls in places where there were already plenty of stores to be found. Elsewhere, stores are still grouped collectively for the convenience of the shoppers, but they have to come from farther away and do more business at a time. That's why there were fairs and street markets. It wouldn't be any sillier to build a regular mall in Tibet than in Texas, for heaven's sake. If people want to buy things, why wouldn't they do it in a mall just as easily as from rickety booths on the street? I'm on a city bus with several people from yoga class - I guess we've just left a class - including George and maybe Cynthia. I've got my purse and something else with me, which I stow on the seat. This is [another] \"funny\" bus - has its seats placed differently from regular buses, and it's up high like the out-of-town-coaches. We're all in a pretty fun mood, and we bowl along through a pretty part of town, with big trees and nice streets, older houses and occasional stores and offices. At one point the bus is diverted by road works from its regular route, and we turn to the left. Then, because of the diversion, we have to drive through a building - actually it's a lot like the Central area Pharmacy except it's got a garage attached. There's 2 sections to it. You can pull in the front or the back - the front is a bit more finished, with matching red brick to the store - you can enter the store from there. The back is different, with painted walls, a little more garage-like. The bus stops in the front; it's going to wait there to catch up to its schedule, and we all pile out of it to stretch our legs and look around. This is a place we know anyway, but it's neat. There's a sort of art exhibit in the back section, various things stuck up on the wall as if a children's school class had done them. Sue S is here (suddenly - I don't remember her being on the bus) and she's looking at them with us. And Tree is here, too - this place is only a short distance from where I live - on the street in back, matter of fact - and he's been exploring down here, I guess. He's come in the back door (both are open), and I pick him up and show him to the people. Actually I'm surprised he's letting me do that, and I'm keeping a good strong grip because he's beginning to get twitchy - but Sue and some others say, oh, what a pretty kitty, and I make up my mind to just go on home with him from here since we're so close, without waiting for the bus. I have to go back in to get my stuff, though. [And I suppose I put Tree down because he wasn't with me for the next part.] I climb up and go to get my purse and things, but while I'm here the bus starts to move. I guess it must have been left in gear or something because it starts going right on out and across the street (the entrance faces another street), and carries on for a couple of blocks. It stops eventually because it runs up against something, I guess, but it's a bit precarious. I can see that the street is going a bit downhill and if it starts to roll again it'll be hard to stop. I get out very carefully and go around to the front, thinking I might push it backward off of the incline, if I can (it's not such a big bus at the moment, you see - it seems like a possibility). But it's just barely starting to move again, and I give it a push, but no go - oh dear. I leap out of the way and remember I still haven't got my things, so I jump back on. The bus gathers momentum and rolls onward, down a street and around a curve and finally comes to rest somewhere, no particular damage done. I am joined now by a little guy in a rather exotic outfit - he's not quite midget-sized, but definitely well below average. (Rather good-looking though - dressed up sort of like, you might say, a warrior-elf. Maybe that's what he is. He's got on some sort of blue loincloth affair, and boots - dark hair, not too long - looks tough but still cute.) (I don't know where he comes from, but I'm not shocked to find him there - maybe he was hiding inside or something - I'm sure he didn't come in from outside.) We discuss the situation, which is more involved than it looks - we need to contact somebody for help. We can't handle this bus on our own (it's become something more like a spaceship now, and much larger), we know there's normally a crew of 2 men to run it, and we can't just leave it where it is and go. (I don't know why.) We poke around some, and find the radio to call the central-whatever with, and send a message to send help. That done, we banter around some more - this all seems like a rather fun adventure - and sort of get cozy. He proposes having sex, right there in the cabin, and I think it sounds like something of a lark, and say yes - I've never had sex with an elf before, for sure, and it might be very different, who knows? We've got nothing better to do till the rescue party gets here, although we don't know when that'll be. [Actually a fair amount of time has passed already.] Suddenly, as he moves over me lying on the floor, he gets bigger - much bigger. He sort of stretches out till he looms over me, and I don't like it. I say so, and next he reaches beyond me over my head to a shelf where he's put something to be handy. It's a kind of face-mask, only it's made of beads (not fine little round beads but cylindrical mostly, they're white and red, maybe orange and yellow too) and it fits over his chin loosely, like a beard. The look on his face has gone very serious, the way you do when the playful part of sex gives way to the other feelings. At that moment, the \"crew\" sent out from the central office arrives.

         "I had driven my car somewhere and ran into some kind of problem and had to walk home. I think I may have walked home to get my car key. I wasn't sure I knew the way back so I just trusted my intuition. I entered a door on a building that seemed to be in a bit of disrepair. It led me through a long somewhat dark hallway. At the other end was another door. When I exited that door I realized that I had just walked through one of the front buildings of my apartment complex and was now in the very front of the complex. I turned to my left, walked to the corner, and then turned to my left again, onto the sidewalk along the main entrance. Shortly after I turned the corner I realized I didn't have my house key. I kept walking as I tried to figure out what to do. It was a time of day when the office wasn't open and maintenance wasn't around so I couldn't go ask them to let me in. I needed a phone and didn't have my cell phone with me and I really needed to use the bathroom. I thought about walking to a public place like a store or gas station but didn't want to walk that far because I really had to go to the bathroom and I was barefoot. I had left my gym shoes in the car. I finally decided to just knock on someone's door and see if they would let me use their phone. I could call the maintenance emergency number and they could come and let me in. A woman answered the door. A very pleasant, white woman. She invited me and began chatting. She seemed to welcome an opportunity to make a new friend, especially in the neighborhood. She said she would just take me to my car. At that point that seemed to be what I needed so I was very grateful. I interrupted her, apologized for doing so, and then told her I needed very badly to use the bathroom and would she mind if I used hers. She said of course not and pointed me toward it. When I finished I flushed it and watched the water rise to the very edge of the top. I wasn't sure whether I should take the tank lid off to stop it and prevent it from possibly overflowing, since I know how to do that, or if I should just do nothing. I decided to do nothing as it seemed to stop rising. I am now asleep in what I think is my own bed. I've been sleeping for some time and wake up very groggy. I stumble to the bathroom attached to the bedroom. After using the toilet, I wake up a bit more and wonder why the d_cor of the room seems so different. The walls and shower curtain have a white, blue, and brown pattern of vertical stripes with flowers randomly throughout. I walk back into the bedroom. I was completely undressed and wanted to put something on so I reach for a t-shirt that is lying on the bed. I suddenly realize I am in someone else's house and I don't even know who it is. As I am quickly trying to pull the t-shirt on I see the blankets move and realize that there is even someone else in the bed. I crouch down to the floor to try to hide but still be able to see who is in the bed. It turns out to be a teenage girl. She notices me and sits upright in bed and looks like she is about to scream. I quickly put my finger to my mouth and whisper, shhh. Please don't say anything. I said something else but I don't know what so she didn't make a sound. Then I told her that I didn't know how I got there or why. I told her I needed help with my car. She quickly got up and pushed her bedroom door closed but not all the way. She said her parents would be very upset if they knew I was there. I don't know if she meant angry or frightened. I told her I would try to leave without them seeing me. Her parents call her so she leaves the room. I'm afraid of who might come in so I try to get into a very small closet. It's hardly deep enough for me to stand with my back to the wall and close the door. When I first open the closet door it is packed with clothes and I'm afraid I won't be able to get in. It's not much wider than I am shoulder-to-shoulder. Once I got in there were only a few clothes on hangers and one very large thing that reminds me of a cushion for an outdoor chaise lounge and the closet door is only partially on its hinges. When I try to close it I can still see into the bedroom in several places. There are now quite a few people out there. It looks like a sitting room, with sofa and chairs. There is a young boy sitting on the sofa facing the closet. I can tell that he sees me and is getting ready to say something to the others. The girl comes back in and starts to tell them about me. I come out of the closet. They don't seem afraid, just surprised and/or curious. I explain as best I can what happened and that I just need a ride to my car. The girl has a teenage brother who is there and one of his friends is there. They say they will be glad to take me to my car. You can see the mischievous look in their eyes, as I am standing there with a t-shirt on and nothing else. The dad and the grandpa say they will go also, in case I need help with the car. I wish I had some more clothes to put on but there is almost nothing in the girl's closet. I ask her brother if I can borrow a pair of his pajama paints and a shirt. He and his friend kind of look around and mumble something as if they're trying to decide if they have anything that I can wear. As the dad and grandpa are ready to leave the friend decides he can't go because he has somewhere else he needs to be and then the brother decides he has homework to do so he isn't going either. The dad and grandpa try to change the brother's mind but are not successful. As we're leaving I tell them that I'm not exactly sure where the car is but I know it's somewhere within a few block radius. I didn't know the name of the street that I left it on, then or now, and told them I wasn't sure how to get back home from there when I started walking. As we're walking to get to my car there is a lot of roadwork or some such going on. We have to walk across some wood plank bridges and things similar to that. When we're crossing one of them I realize that I knew that stream was there in our neighborhood. They were a couple of times when we had to stretch our legs to get from the bridge back onto the grass. I learn that these men work in the fishing industry. We walk by a place where a lot of their coworkers are working. They are told that they are really needed right now. They tell me it won't take long and I can't wait for them. There are maybe 20 men standing in this container that looks like an orange commercial dumpster. The top edge of the dumpster is just a bit taller than the tallest men in it. A bunch of seals are about to be released into this container and all of these men need to be standing in there when they do it for the safety of the seals, though it's not to catch them or help them in. They all stand with their backs to the side where the seals are to be released into the container. This is a very dangerous part of their job. Some men have lost their lives doing this. They all realize it is a risk of their job. I am very concerned for all of them. I hate to see people having to do things that they know could cost them their life. I'm especially concerned here, though, because this dad and grandpa are going in. I wonder if their family knows about this or should be told that they are getting ready to help with this. Now the container is almost twice as deep as it was. The dad seems to be near the surface and the grandpa near the bottom. The dad asks him to change places with him because, apparently, the bottom is much more dangerous. Grandpa is standing next to some kind of mechanism that needs to be operated as the seals are released. He tells the dad no, that he needs to operate this mechanism and implies that he has lived his life and would rather he be the one to die if anyone is going to. The seals are released and are falling into the container from what looks like a waterfall stream of water coming from the transport vehicle. I head back to their house to tell the woman what is going on. I'm not sure why, but now I know that her name is Connie B. Another woman is there talking with her. The three of us are talking. This other woman says a couple of things that I don't understand, using terms or phrases that I'm not familiar with, yet it still sounds very crude, or crass, and ill-mannered. After she leaves Connie B begins talking about her and how she talks. She repeats one thing that she says and looks at me in disbelief as she asks me if I can believe she even said that. I'm just sitting there silent because I don't know what it meant. Connie B asks me if I know what it is and I shake my head no. I'm thinking that I'm not sure I even want to know, but she tells me anyway. It has something to do with bowel movements. I agree that it was very crass and unpleasant talk. I want to get my own clothes on and go home. Dad and grandpa are back and tell me that Connie B had put my clothes in the bathroom. I went in and closed the door. I wanted to use the toilet before I got dressed but saw out of the corner of my eye that there was something in it. I reached to flush it. Just as I did I realized they had put my clothes somewhere so that they had been partially hanging in the toilet. That's what I had seen out of the corner of my eye. I quickly grabbed them so the toilet wouldn't have a chance of trying to suck them down and getting clogged up or creating a problem or anything. Now I'm frustrated because I wanted to get dressed but my clothes are wet. I decide that they aren't that wet and I really want to go home so I'm just going to put them on anyway, the way they are.",

The dad asks him to change places with him because, apparently, the bottom is much more dangerous. Grandpa is standing next to some kind of mechanism that needs to be operated as the seals are released. He tells the dad no, that he needs to operate this mechanism and implies that he has lived his life and would rather he be the one to die if anyone is going to. The seals are released and are falling into the container from what looks like a waterfall stream of water coming from the transport vehicle. I head back to their house to tell the woman what is going on. I'm not sure why, but now I know that her name is Connie B. Another woman is there talking with her. The three of us are talking. This other woman says a couple of things that I don't understand, using terms or phrases that I'm not familiar with, yet it still sounds very crude, or crass, and ill-mannered. After she leaves Connie B begins talking about her and how she talks. She repeats one thing that she says and looks at me in disbelief as she asks me if I can believe she even said that. I'm just sitting there silent because I don't know what it meant. Connie B asks me if I know what it is and I shake my head no. I'm thinking that I'm not sure I even want to know, but she tells me anyway. It has something to do with bowel movements. I agree that it was very crass and unpleasant talk. I want to get my own clothes on and go home. Dad and grandpa are back and tell me that Connie B had put my clothes in the bathroom. I went in and closed the door. I wanted to use the toilet before I got dressed but saw out of the corner of my eye that there was something in it. I reached to flush it. Just as I did I realized they had put my clothes somewhere so that they had been partially hanging in the toilet. That's what I had seen out of the corner of my eye. I quickly grabbed them so the toilet wouldn't have a chance of trying to suck them down and getting clogged up or creating a problem or anything. Now I'm frustrated because I wanted to get dressed but my clothes are wet. I decide that they aren't that wet and I really want to go home so I'm just going to put them on anyway, the way they are.\nSymbols: - Car: To dream that you forget or can't find where you parked your car indicates that you are dissatisfied or unhappy with an aspect of your waking life.

         "I was in Bill C's office, sitting across from him at his desk. It wasn't a tense conversation but certainly very reserved. He said something about it being a long time and I responded that yes it has been about a year and a half. I was wondering why he had asked me to come and meet with him. I was also feeling surprised at myself for agreeing to come. I wished he would just quit stalling and tell me why he had asked me there. It felt like he was avoiding telling me because he wasn't sure how I would react. He continues to make small talk, still being very reserved and not smiling much if at all. When he does smile it is barely a smile. Bryan N comes into Bill's office. I don't know if he realizes that I am in there or not. But he comes in anyway to ask Bill C something. Yet, it doesn't seem like they speak at all. Because of something Bill C says I finally realize that he has asked me here to ask me to come back to work for him. I'm thinking about the fact that I want absolutely nothing to do with Bryan N but that I also don't think I could come back because of the way things were the last time but also because I don't think they would be any different if I came back. I doubt that Bill C would respect me or my abilities any more this time than he did the last. But I don't think any of the problems would change. He was walking around the office as he was talking to me. For the first time since I arrived I noticed his hair when he turned his back to me. He had let it grow very long. It came just below the collar of his shirt. It was black, with no grey and very curly, with all of it hanging in small curls. I thought it looked very odd, I didn't like it at all. I couldn't believe that he had wanted to do that or that he liked it, or that Jane C liked it. He finally said something to me about it. When he got very close to me, and was facing me, I realized that it was a wig because I could see part of the cap across his forehead. I told him that. He said something about his hair becoming even thinner. To me that just isn't a big deal, even though I know it is to men who are balding. I just don't think balding men are any less attractive. He said that's why he was wearing this wig. He took it off and I told him that I thought he looked so much better without it. He left off. There are two other women who come into his office and then a third comes in. All three are dressed very professionally in business suits. Two of them are my age or maybe even older. One is a younger, maybe in her mid to late 30's. I'm very surprised that he hired these three women, especially since they all three appear to be very capable professionally, to sell and conduct his training. Then I see two very young women leave the office and find out they are employed there as well. I think to myself that they seem more like the type of women I would expect Bill C to hire. They are both very dressed very provocatively and outrageously. One is wearing an animal print outfit. The skirt is so short it just barely covers her bottom. The other one is dressed in black leather. She is wearing something that looks something like a pair of shorts but the bottom hem doesn't even come to the bottom of her buttocks. At least two or three inches of her buttocks are uncovered and she is aware of this. It's intentional. I think it's outrageous. I look at the other three women with this questioning look of disbelief. They give me a look that says, I know. Can you believe it? I say something to Bill C. He says that he doesn't think it's a problem. I try to explain to him that they represent him and his company and ask if that's the kind of impression he wants people to get about him and the company. I ask him if he isn't at all concerned about what that is doing to his reputation. I tell him that it is absolutely unprofessional and unacceptable in a business office, in any professional environment but especially in his business. There are now about a dozen women in the office. I say something to one of them about her shoes. She, and the others, seem glad to hear whatever it is that I say, finding it to be useful professional advice. Bill C suggests that I take them all back to the training room and talk to them about things like that. I don't have a lot of time but I tell him that I will be happy to go back and share a few things with them about shoes. That won't take long but they are very important to a woman's professional appearance. I followed Bill C back to the training room and I'm feeling butterflies in my stomach because I haven't been there since I left the company. I know that he has made a lot of changes to the office since then. As we're walking I'm thinking about various dreams that I've had about the office over the last year and half. At the end of a long hallway he led me into a training room through a doorway to our right. It's a very small room. I look around, surprised that it's a training room. It's pretty messy and I don't see any chairs or tables. At the back of that room there is another door, along the left wall. He goes through that door so I follow him and realize that it leads to another training room. Apparently the second doorway is one that the trainers use to go back and forth between the two rooms. It has another entrance for clients. I don't know why he didn't take me in that door. It's a much larger room but it is also a mess. There are no tables and chairs set up for training and there are boxes and stuff sitting everywhere. It looks like they are using it as a storage room. Women start coming in and finding places to sit. Now, Lisa U is there. I suggested we do the presentation together and she said that was fine. After I said I wondered how we do it together given that it was all impromptu. I suggested she just chime in whenever she had anything to add. She was sitting in a chair to my left, leaned over resting her elbows on her knees and her chin in her hands. She nodded yes and said that was fine. I decided that I would do this by talking about the shoes that each of the women attending had on and discuss why they were or were not appropriate for business. So I told Lisa U we would just alternate. I would discuss a pair and then she could discuss a pair, etc. Now there are easily thirty or more women there. It appears as though there are a row of three rooms that are each connected to the other by a doorway just slightly wider than a normal doorway would be. The women have taken their chairs and lined them around the walls of each room. We're having to go through each room as we talk so all of the women can hear what we're saying and see the shoe we're talking about. I ask the first woman to my right in the main room to hand me one of her shoes. I decided to have her pass the shoe around for each woman in all three rooms to look at it. This first shoe was unusual so I told Lisa U she was welcome to do the first one because I knew she would have no problem coming up with something. After just a short time Lisa U had to leave. I realized it was taking a long time because we were passing each shoe around. I didn't want to be there much longer and I wanted to get this over, even though the women seemed to be enjoying it and they were giving me the impression that they were learning something. After we had done the first few pairs I started skipping some women's shoes if they were very similar to a pair we had already discussed. I also thought that doing it this way was creating too much downtime. Quite a few women had to leave early, so there were a lot fewer there. I asked them all to move their chairs into the one largest room, in rows, so they could all fit in one room. One of the shoes I discussed was black with about a two-inch heal. It had few rhinestones in different colors on the top, placed to create a very subtle and tasteful design. I told the women that this was one of my favorites so far because it was very professional yet the rhinestones set it a part a bit and gave it a little style. However, it was also very dirty so I emphasized the importance of taking care of their shoes and how dirty shoes can impact the impression someone gets about you. People get the impression that you don't take care of things or that you don't care about impressions or about details and that kind of thing. One of the shoes was a closed-toe flat with hardly any heel to it at all. I told them that my problem with it was that it would not be comfortable for very long if they spend a lot of time on their feet because it doesn't offer support for the legs and back. It would take a toll on your posture. Also your feet, legs, and back may start to feel tired or achy and that would take a toll on your mood or attitude, which in turn impacts your work, especially if you are interacting with other people. Another pair that I discussed was a dress thong with was also almost no heel. I told them that the same thing applied to this pair because of the lack of heel but that a thong of any kind was also way too casual and inappropriate for business attire. There was a closed-toe wedge that I showed and said that I particularly liked because the height of the heel gave it a more professional appearance. Because it was a wedge it would be very comfortable, unlike a regular high-heeled shoe, and not cause any of the foot, leg, or back discomfort that can be associated with high-heeled shoes. There was one that was a closed-toe wedge. It was two-toned, with the bottom half all around the shoe being brown and the upper half being tan or beige. It had some type of embellishment on the top of each shoe. It might have been a very small tassle or bow but I can't recall exactly. I held it up saying that it was also one of my favorites. I reminded them of the positives of a wedge-heel. I mentioned that closed-toes shoes are more professional than anything with an open-toe. But then I also mentioned that the style, with the two colors and the embellishment on top was also a positive. It provided a sense of style and implies creativity.",

         "I'm with some other people - friends, I'm not sure who, but they were like MT, maybe even my brother, and even Don and Lauren or somebody, and we were going to look at a house. This house was on a residential street that had some very nice large houses on it. We were looking for a house that we might want to rent, and we first went past it to the end of the street, and we looked at the numbers and went back to it. The houses at the end of the street were extremely nice, and looked very expensive indeed, and when we backed up a bit to go back to the house we wanted, it seemed to be at least something less formal, and maybe more likely, but still an awfully nice house. We were surprised that the person we were thinking of renting it from lived there, because it was somebody more or less our age, like us, that wouldn't necessarily be able to afford a big house like that. So we went up to the door and knocked and looked at the outside. The person that answered was female, and she let us in and said she'd show us around, nice and friendly, and what we saw on the inside is not at all what we expected. There was this enormous room, broken up into areas, and it had another level to it as though it were a sunken living room. It was very open - there wasn't a whole lot of furniture. There were people around, and it looked very reminiscent of a \"hippie pad\" from the early 70's or 60's or more like a commune where a lot of people were living in the same place and just sort of having a good time, and not just being roommates or residents or something like that. And there seemed to be people having a good time around. The girl that was with us just took us on through into the living-room sort of area and straight across to a door that led into a small sort of shed, really, that you're meant to go through and you go outside from. Before we got there, I was looking outside through a plate glass window on the right and saw a kind of little patio or garden sort of thing, it wasn't real small, it had bushes and stuff in it. And there was a cat or two sitting out there [something happened about the cat but I don't quite remember] - it was large and black (if memory serves), and it kinda did something and left. Then we went into the shed and I was bringing up the rear. Everybody went back out again, but I was interested in something that was hanging in the shed. It was kind of like a potting shed, although they had [\"been stuck\" (?)] certain things as well as plants - it was maybe kind of a greenhouse, I guess, or something in between. I took whatever it was off the wall and went outside with it to have a better look at it. It seems to me that it was like, terracotta [and I don't remember what it was]. After I'd looked at it [and nobody else was ____?] I took it back in and hung it back up on the wall again. NEXT: I am on trial for something that I do not know exactly, but it surely would have had to do with something like embezzlement. What they were questioning was how I had so much money to spend, why I had such nice things. There were a whole lot of people there, it was more like an auditorium than a courtroom - there were people up on the sides, like bleachers or something, and the light in the courtroom was very bright. The prosecutor was very strong and powerful, he wasn't entirely angry - of course he wasn't supposed to be angry, but he was real determined that I should be - examined as thoroughly as possible, in case I had done this. (Whatever it was.) He would ask how I could afford to buy - like clothes, or something, how I could afford to have such nice things, on my salary. During the course of this trial, they had called for a physical examination of me, like an operation, even - they wanted to make cuts in my body to examine something - not going all the way inside to the organs, and so forth, but kinda superficial cuts where you cut the skin in long straight lines down the arms and down the torso. Maybe something to do with bacteria or something, I don't know. I was real concerned about that, but I was not real concerned about the trial in general. There was a place in the back of the courtroom - it was rather more like a dressing room, and I had, of course, my lawyer, and some other people helping me out - I guess they would be like people on my lawyer's staff or something - an older woman, blonde, professional-type woman; my lawyer was a man in a suit, you know, your basic sort of lawyer, certainly not a kid, but your basic yuppie professional. And they were, like, attending on me like I was - oh, dear, somebody like a TV star or something - I would be in the back, getting \"dressed\", getting my hair done, stuff like that, it wasn't very luxurious, but it was certainly not what you would expect of being in a courtroom. In fact, I wasn't even in the courtroom - I wasn't even paying attention to how the trial was going except for the sound of the prosecutor's voice. He was quite loud and determined - making a \"show\" for the audience - and most of 'em were my friends, and they didn't want to see me get into trouble. They were interested, certainly, but he was definitely going to have to prove what he alleged. And all of these questions seemed to me to be real obviously geared to getting me into trouble, because everything he was asking could be answered very simply, and he wasn't listening to what - well, it wasn't that he wasn't listening to what I had to say because I wasn't there for him to hear, but I was the one who could clear it up in the first place, and until he got me on the stand where I could tell him these things, it seemed like there wasn't much point in him even asking. Nobody else could tell him that I wouldn't buy anything very expensive unless it was on sale, and I charge things, and pay them out, and sometimes people take me to lunch or something, or I may buy myself meals and not get my hair cut, things like that. I certainly haven't stolen anything, and sometimes I do think I spend more than I need to - or, well, not more than I need to but more than I can afford to, but that's my problem, it's certainly not anybody else's money and I don't know why I should be on trial for it. But this physical examination thing concerned me quite a lot. There's kind of a conflict here. I have the impression that I have already had this examination, and it didn't really work the way they thought it was going to. But I think that isn't logical because that wouldn't have happened and there wouldn't have been any point in me being concerned about it further, but I was - I was concerned about having it done correctly, and fascinated with the procedure itself. And so there weren't actually any cuts on my body, it's as though they had tried to and it wouldn't do it. So I was interested in that, and I just decided I'd do it myself. I got something to cut with - you see, I'm not in the courtroom at the moment, and whoever has been with me in the \"dressing room\" area - what I mean by that, by the way, is that it's back off of the courtroom, assuredly, but it's not closed off from it - there's a place where you can go, like, to change clothes, but it's just a back room open to the courtroom, all the way in the back where nobody can turn around and look at you, or nobody's doing it, they're not - or, their attention is out in the middle of the court - anyway, so whoever has been with me back there has gone away so I'm alone, and I got something like a razor blade and started to make these cuts myself. [It surely would be awkward if you did that - lying down, and trying to even make the sort of cut I'm talking about with one arm, without looking at it, but it's as though I wasn't doing it that way, it's as though I was doing it from outside my body. And was a little bit ragged and awkward at it at first, but eventually I got the hang of it and - this is how it seemed awkward to me, as though I was doing it from right over my body, and - just like you would a doll, you know - straight down, and I discovered that it was awkward to do - the right-hand side of my body (lying on the ground), which seems to be the left-hand side from the position I'm actually cutting in. So, what I needed to do is to move around, so I moved down to where I was really facing the side of my body to do that. This is all very slow and awkward, but there wasn't any blood or anything. Well, I did that, and I don't know anything more about it - it obviously didn't hurt particularly, I know I kept expecting it to - I kept expecting it to feel at least, you know, like it does when you cut yourself, so I was a little bit surprised that it didn't bleed, but I wasn't worried about there being any real damage or anything because I knew I would heal up. And quite sure that I knew I'd heal up without scars, too. Just didn't seem that big a deal. But now I felt like I had done it, for them. That they would be happy now. It was like I have accomplished whatever it was they wanted me to do for them.",

         "Interpret this dream: I'm with some other people - friends, I'm not sure who, but they were like MT, maybe even my brother, and even Don and Lauren or somebody, and we were going to look at a house. This house was on a residential street that had some very nice large houses on it. We were looking for a house that we might want to rent, and we first went past it to the end of the street, and we looked at the numbers and went back to it. The houses at the end of the street were extremely nice, and looked very expensive indeed, and when we backed up a bit to go back to the house we wanted, it seemed to be at least something less formal, and maybe more likely, but still an awfully nice house. We were surprised that the person we were thinking of renting it from lived there, because it was somebody more or less our age, like us, that wouldn't necessarily be able to afford a big house like that. So we went up to the door and knocked and looked at the outside. The person that answered was female, and she let us in and said she'd show us around, nice and friendly, and what we saw on the inside is not at all what we expected. There was this enormous room, broken up into areas, and it had another level to it as though it were a sunken living room. It was very open - there wasn't a whole lot of furniture. There were people around, and it looked very reminiscent of a \"hippie pad\" from the early 70's or 60's or more like a commune where a lot of people were living in the same place and just sort of having a good time, and not just being roommates or residents or something like that. And there seemed to be people having a good time around. The girl that was with us just took us on through into the living-room sort of area and straight across to a door that led into a small sort of shed, really, that you're meant to go through and you go outside from. Before we got there, I was looking outside through a plate glass window on the right and saw a kind of little patio or garden sort of thing, it wasn't real small, it had bushes and stuff in it. And there was a cat or two sitting out there [something happened about the cat but I don't quite remember] - it was large and black (if memory serves), and it kinda did something and left. Then we went into the shed and I was bringing up the rear. Everybody went back out again, but I was interested in something that was hanging in the shed. It was kind of like a potting shed, although they had [\"been stuck\" (?)] certain things as well as plants - it was maybe kind of a greenhouse, I guess, or something in between. I took whatever it was off the wall and went outside with it to have a better look at it. It seems to me that it was like, terracotta [and I don't remember what it was]. After I'd looked at it [and nobody else was ____?] I took it back in and hung it back up on the wall again. NEXT: I am on trial for something that I do not know exactly, but it surely would have had to do with something like embezzlement. What they were questioning was how I had so much money to spend, why I had such nice things. There were a whole lot of people there, it was more like an auditorium than a courtroom - there were people up on the sides, like bleachers or something, and the light in the courtroom was very bright. The prosecutor was very strong and powerful, he wasn't entirely angry - of course he wasn't supposed to be angry, but he was real determined that I should be - examined as thoroughly as possible, in case I had done this. (Whatever it was.) He would ask how I could afford to buy - like clothes, or something, how I could afford to have such nice things, on my salary. During the course of this trial, they had called for a physical examination of me, like an operation, even - they wanted to make cuts in my body to examine something - not going all the way inside to the organs, and so forth, but kinda superficial cuts where you cut the skin in long straight lines down the arms and down the torso. Maybe something to do with bacteria or something, I don't know. I was real concerned about that, but I was not real concerned about the trial in general. There was a place in the back of the courtroom - it was rather more like a dressing room, and I had, of course, my lawyer, and some other people helping me out - I guess they would be like people on my lawyer's staff or something - an older woman, blonde, professional-type woman; my lawyer was a man in a suit, you know, your basic sort of lawyer, certainly not a kid, but your basic yuppie professional. And they were, like, attending on me like I was - oh, dear, somebody like a TV star or something - I would be in the back, getting \"dressed\", getting my hair done, stuff like that, it wasn't very luxurious, but it was certainly not what you would expect of being in a courtroom. In fact, I wasn't even in the courtroom - I wasn't even paying attention to how the trial was going except for the sound of the prosecutor's voice. He was quite loud and determined - making a \"show\" for the audience - and most of 'em were my friends, and they didn't want to see me get into trouble. They were interested, certainly, but he was definitely going to have to prove what he alleged. And all of these questions seemed to me to be real obviously geared to getting me into trouble, because everything he was asking could be answered very simply, and he wasn't listening to what - well, it wasn't that he wasn't listening to what I had to say because I wasn't there for him to hear, but I was the one who could clear it up in the first place, and until he got me on the stand where I could tell him these things, it seemed like there wasn't much point in him even asking. Nobody else could tell him that I wouldn't buy anything very expensive unless it was on sale, and I charge things, and pay them out, and sometimes people take me to lunch or something, or I may buy myself meals and not get my hair cut, things like that. I certainly haven't stolen anything, and sometimes I do think I spend more than I need to - or, well, not more than I need to but more than I can afford to, but that's my problem, it's certainly not anybody else's money and I don't know why I should be on trial for it. But this physical examination thing concerned me quite a lot. There's kind of a conflict here. I have the impression that I have already had this examination, and it didn't really work the way they thought it was going to. But I think that isn't logical because that wouldn't have happened and there wouldn't have been any point in me being concerned about it further, but I was - I was concerned about having it done correctly, and fascinated with the procedure itself.

         "The dream started with a conversation between two men. One of them was Charlton Heston, who was a young rising lawyer, and I'm not sure who the other man was. Heston had some big trial coming up in which he thought he would make his reputation. He was saying to the other person that if he could win this case, he would then be voted as the outstanding lawyer of that region, and this would go a long way in achieving this particular title or national recognition that he was seeking. The other person asked him if he realized how difficult that this would be and how many skillful lawyers had previously failed in winning a conviction. Heston replied that he did, but said that he had new information, that he had got this thru extensive wire tapping and it seemed as if these wire tapping devices had been hidden all about various army spots, and there was one picture of somebody from the Air Force putting on a helmet and as they were doing so, Heston's voice was saying even in their helmets which they think are their most private possessions, a bug has been hid. Then the scene shifted, and it's a little fuzzy, but it had to do with possession of a boat. I believe Gilbert Roland, the movie star, was the owner of this little boat. This boat lay in a harbour and the way that one got to it was throwing a line over from shore which caught on a chain stretched across a log, and by pulling on this, the boat was pulled over in such a way that the gang plank or buoyant plank type of arrangement was provided. There was quit a squabble over who owned this boat as the boat was still in the process of being paid for. There were some women connected with this boat, and it seems in some fashion as if they were tied up with the previous trial, but they were going to try and get some further information. It seemed as if I were a friend of Gilbert Roland and was standing nearby when a couple of women and an old man somewhat short in stature arrived by the boat and, with a great deal of fuss and a great deal of noise, managed to come over and get on board. I said something to Gilbert Roland about what are they doing. He said they are trying to take the boat. I said of course they can't. Then someone stood across the desk, the deck. A small card which, upon reading it, said that if proper notice had not been given, as to something when payments were started on the boat, then the rights to ownership were jeopardized. Somehow these other people had discovered this and were using this as a legal gimmick to take over the boat. We had to take off from the boat and watched rather sullenly as they all boarded the boat, which was aluminum, and up in the cabin area it could be seen that it was fairly well used as there were dents in places where paint had been rubbed off. It seemed that the purpose of this was to try and attain the boat primarily for the old man, who was a fisherman. There were nets nearby, black nets, that had sort of had gold-colored weights distributed along their edge that we used to throw in the sea. I was curious about the weights and went over and looked at them, and noticed that they appeared to be made of hollow glass with one side open, that there was a great deal of sand packed in them. Then the old man got on some small kind of velocipede, something that had a motor, and that had one wheel at the handlebars. It was very small and unlike anything else that I have ever seen before. He got on this and began to drive forward a bit and then to try and back up. He was having trouble. He drove forward a bit again, but was not very skillful in maneuvering it and then finally he got it backed up and headed off. As he did so, I said something to Gilbert Roland about hadn't he put he wheel in the wrong direction. Wasn't the wheel supposed to be in the front as he drove, rather than behind facing on the velocipede as he was? He said that no, the way the man was driving was alright. This is the same old man connected with the boat. It also seemed as if the velocipede had changed hands in the transaction. Somehow the loss of the boat changed our plans and it seemed as if new evidence had to be obtained. So I was saying to some other person who was concerned with this, but who was not Gilbert  Roland, well, let's go out and start to get familiar with some gals who would be involved so that we could hopefully obtain some information from them. We started to g thru the neighborhood hoping to spot some females. On the back porch of one sort of rundown looking house there was a young girl with a sort of blotchy complexion, but a face almost completely covered by freckles who appeared near the back door. It seemed as if I vaguely knew this girl from some other connection, and I said to her, \"Did you know that you really look quite different from the picture I had seen of you?\" And she said, \"How?\" I told her that she was really much prettier than she had been in this other picture. I sat down on the steps and she came over towards me and sat on my lap, and I began to kiss her. I was a little hesitant to do so because I thought for some reason I had bad breath, but I then kissed her and she did not know how to respond very well and started to giggle as well. It seemed then that this other person who I knew appeared and said , \"She looks like she's all of about 12 years old.\" Then I said in a somewhat facetious fashion to her, \"No, you kiss as though you must be a 13-year-old girl.\" Then I felt guilty about taking advantage of her naiveness and lack of experience and left. As I did so, she seemed disappointed and I said, \"Well, I will come back someday and see you again.\" As I left I remember walking into some other hallway, and it had a torn screen door, and I said back out through the screen door to her, \"Well, it has been different anyhow.\" Then as I began to walk down the hallway of this building, I looked off to the right and noticed an old man dozing in a chair as if it might have been a room of a private club. Walking further down the hallway, I glanced in this one room and saw Karlis or Mrs. Garrett, and some other person whom I recognized. All of these people are associated with parapsychological activities. I waved to them and seemed to know that the parapsychological convention was about to get underway that afternoon or the next day and thought that when they noticed me they would probably wonder why I was all dressed in fatigues. It seemed I had been out on some difficult mission, and this was an occasion for having a complete set of fatigues on. They were somewhat muddy so I decided I better go back to my room and start to get ready and cleaned up for the convention. As I walked along I noticed over on the left hand side a little brass mask hat had been painted orange and a great deal of the paint had peeled off. This was lying on the ground along with some other pieces of bric-a-brac. There were various people in the hall as I passed along, and then it seemed as if at one point I encountered Carlos again, and I started a discussion with him, but he seemed preoccupied, in a hurry or something, and I thought, \"Well, I'll have a chance to talk to him during the convention.\" As I continued to walk down the hall, I approached the door that was to be my room. This was a door on the right hand side and it seemed as if it were slightly ajar. Across the hallway there were some people. They were commenting something about the unusual decor that was in my room. Someone was saying to the others sitting in the room that if you get a chance when the door was open to look thru because it was furnished quite distinctively. As I pushed open my door and started thru it, I was aware that some large piece of furniture had been pushed away from the corner of the wall more toward the center of the room, and there was a woman busily washing the dishes. The room had been cleaned up and I was pleased over this and that things were being tidied up. I thought the woman was probably Doris, but she had her back away from me, and I was anxious to see who it was when Calvin awakened me. There was also a fragment about going to see a movie. I remember going into the movie with some other person and the ticket seller had pushed the two stubs into my palm. The person I was with was quit a few feet up ahead starting to look for the hallway or entranceway into the main theater. It was a very large theater and somebody was calling down asking he ticket seller how do they get to the certain floor, and he was trying to give them directions, but he was not sure which floor it was that he was on. Then someone said to him, \"Well, this is the 4th floor.\" I believe this other person with me was a girl that I seemed to know in the dream, but I'm not sure exactly who she was. I have a feeling she was a red-haired girl who is in my student nurse class. As we entered the theater, we sort of kept going down various dead ends and had trouble finding the proper floor. At one point we emerged at a restaurant, and I just glanced around the corner and noticed that there were several people sitting about in wicker chairs at this restaurant. I believe we finally found seats someplace and sat down. I have a vague feeling the title of the movie was supposed to be Dr. Newman, M.D. This is a picture I believe that had been mentioned in my nursing class as being one to do with psychiatrists. There was the feeling that psychiatry was also somehow tied up wit the initial part about Charlton Heston and I did not appear to be part of that actual setting so that it may have been that once arriving at the movie, we were seeing this scene with Charlton Heston and the courtroom part, although I was a participant in the rest of the dream. This seemed like a very long dream and I would estimate it as 15-20 minutes in length.",

I thought the woman was probably Doris, but she had her back away from me, and I was anxious to see who it was when Calvin awakened me. There was also a fragment about going to see a movie. I remember going into the movie with some other person and the ticket seller had pushed the two stubs into my palm. The person I was with was quit a few feet up ahead starting to look for the hallway or entranceway into the main theater. It was a very large theater and somebody was calling down asking he ticket seller how do they get to the certain floor, and he was trying to give them directions, but he was not sure which floor it was that he was on. Then someone said to him, \"Well, this is the 4th floor.\" I believe this other person with me was a girl that I seemed to know in the dream, but I'm not sure exactly who she was. I have a feeling she was a red-haired girl who is in my student nurse class. As we entered the theater, we sort of kept going down various dead ends and had trouble finding the proper floor. At one point we emerged at a restaurant, and I just glanced around the corner and noticed that there were several people sitting about in wicker chairs at this restaurant. I believe we finally found seats someplace and sat down. I have a vague feeling the title of the movie was supposed to be Dr. Newman, M.D. This is a picture I believe that had been mentioned in my nursing class as being one to do with psychiatrists. There was the feeling that psychiatry was also somehow tied up wit the initial part about Charlton Heston and I did not appear to be part of that actual setting so that it may have been that once arriving at the movie, we were seeing this scene with Charlton Heston and the courtroom part, although I was a participant in the rest of the dream. This seemed like a very long dream and I would estimate it as 15-20 minutes in length.\nSymbols: - Traitor: To dream that you are or accused of being a traitor signifies self guilt. Something is eating you up inside. You may have done something that you are not proud of.\n - Fraud: To dream that a fraud has been committed against you indicates that you are too trusting of others. Be aware of dishonest people around you. Perhaps you are subconsciously suspicious of someone.\n - Crime: To dream that you or someone commits a crime represents feelings of guilt and shame.

         "This dream begins in a courtroom. There's a group of people filing into the courtroom taking their seats, getting ready for the trial. The title of the case is announced and it's something like Brown vs. U.S. or something like that, or Brown vs. some other party. At any rate two of the principal characters that appear first are two women who are in some way related, and they're rather haggard-looking, but they're heavily made up and quite frankly they look like a couple of prostitutes, but they still bear some elements of attractiveness. They seem to be talking with their lawyer, and the other party in the case seems to be a person who is a former lover of one of the girls, or at least used to go with one of the girls. He's on the witness stand. He has a very long, long nose, hooked, like Geo. C. Scott. He's giving testimony and it goes something like this: \"Yes, I cared for this girl and I liked her very much. We used to rendezvous on the river or lake in a houseboat. I enjoyed being with her so much that I didn't try to work, although I've never worked in my life, but I didn't care to after this because I enjoyed being with her so much.\" That's roughly about what he had to say. It then seems the scene switches and it's a kind off flashback to what led to the courtroom trial. In this scene we see the man who's on the witness stand and the one girl who was ______ to rendezvous. They are in some kind of boat, and they're rowing or paddling out to the houseboat. In the boat there seems to be some kind of a heavy sack, something very heavy, and it seems to be essential for their enjoyment that evening. I don't know what it is, but anyway they finally arrive at this houseboat and this trip going across the lake is taking place at night, and it's during the wintertime and there's ice, not ice but rather snow fallen and the houseboat seems to be anchored somewhere near a coastline, but it seems like a deserted coastline sort of like an island in the middle of this lake because right nearby are a lot of debris, dead logs and pieces of wood that seem to have fallen or accumulated there near the island. At any rate as he pulls up alongside, the girl gets out first and seemingly true to his statement that he never works, the girl drags this very heavy sack out of the boat and it strikes me that it weighs about 100 pounds. She's dragging it on up to the front door of this houseboat, which is  very unusual houseboat because it sits very low in the water, and this house is kind of modern looking and furnished very contemporary. There's a fireplace in it, I believe. It had large glass sliding doors and before the guy gets out of the boat, the next scene I remember is someone else, another man has entered the scene. I believe it's my friend Bill and he is explaining to this guy that, yes, his girl's gone. He's not going to tell him how, but she has gone. He's seen to that very quickly. This guy runs all over the houseboat looking for her, ran out the back of it to kind of a back porch, and looks around the river, which is all dark and snowy and seemingly Bill is there to get this guy for something. His first thoughts are, \"He's overwrought about the girl being gone.\" Then finally he realizes that he has to get out of there himself, maybe this way he can find the girl also. So he somehow takes off and Bill takes off after him. The next scene is back on the mainland and it's daytime. They're coming into the large hotel. It seems to me that the guy with the long nose is beginning to seem like me and he starts to walk up an outside staircase that's like the one on the Ashe Administration Bldg. at the university, except it's got, not, it's about like that, yeah, and he's walking up it very slowly like he's trying not to draw attention from Bill who's not too far behind him. Yet I seem to be stepping not from step to step, but landing to landing somehow. On one of the landings I meet someone I know. I engage in an extremely short conversation, I just forget about what, and I look back and I believe Bill is beginning to discover my presence, and he's suspicious of this person he sees climbing up the stairs. So I continue to climb, but I start climbing the stairs and sure enough, Bill runs up to the stairs and I dash into the nearest door into the hotel and I contemplate taking the elevator, which is right inside the door, down, but since I'm on the 4th floor, it would take quite a while for the elevator to come up because it's on the 1st floor. This elevator looks just like one that's in a building on I don't remember the name of the road, it's 42nd Avenue. It looks just like this elevator, and anyway, I decide that if I wait until the elevator comes up, he may catch me, so in the meantime a Negro porter who works in the hotel -- possibly a bellboy -- has come upstairs and he pushes the elevator button, but I just run past him and this is the beginning of a very grand chase through the hotel. I recall running through a hallway and around a bend, hallway curves, and there's a woman with her two children and her mother. She seemed Italian. She seems to recognize me and I say something to her like, \"I can't talk to you now,\" and I continue to run by. The next scene I recall clearly is running up to an area near a stairway and I stop to rest, and a Negro woman who is also an employee of the hotel, and I believe she's a waiter, but she has bedspreads over her arm, making me think in the dream she is a housemaid, I mean a, well, at any rate she says to me that, \"Why did you leave? You know there was a young girl here in the hotel that was interested in you. A lot of people missed you. This girl was going to stay only because you were here, and I've got some tips for you that people left.\" This whole conversation then seems to induce in me feelings that I was not too long ago a waiter at this hotel, and it seems to me this is a hotel in Atlantic City where I was a waiter. It doesn't necessarily resemble it though. I have taken off one hat that I have on and there's a small cap on underneath the hat. I'm sitting down on the carpet and this woman is sitting in some kind of a chair or the sofa next to me. I'm looking kind of over her lap at the elevators, watching for Bill. Sure enough I see him appear and I take off again. I run downstairs to what appears to be a very old synagogue or some kind of a religious meeting place. It must be a synagogue. It was very dark because all the wood is all mahogany or walnut or something, it was all very dark. The pews as dark as the walls, the altar, the heavy old-fashioned staircase leading down to it. I'm down there and somehow Bill enters from a different way, from the ground floor. I dash through the building and through this room and upstairs and as I get upstairs, lo and behold, there's a lock on the door with a key in it, and it's on the outside so that I can lock the door, and Bill will be stuck downstairs. I just casually turn the key and kind of \"that's that\" sort of attitude. I dash out the back door, run over to a car and started to take off. Then that's where the dream ended.  In the very first scene in the courtroom, one of the girls, the one that the guy with the long nose got involved with, they both have coats on, kind of like these light tan winter coats of fall coats. As I explained, they're rather raggedly looking although there are some elements of attractiveness left. The one that has a large glass bowl, she seems to have on where she would normally have on a pair of pants, and there's a skirt around this bowl, sort of trying to cover it, but there's a little bit of the bowl that appears above this skirt. It's like the bowl had two holes through it so she could put her legs through. It strikes me that she's done a poor job of dressing because you can see through the bowl slightly because it is glass down to the bottom of it, but nothing but a jumble of clothes, that is folded shirttails and pants that she has on under it and other things seem to be apparent, but it was rather gross-looking. These girls are sisters, I believe. This whole dream was in color, all natural color. Everything in it practically had color, beginning with the first scene to the last. The outstanding things that had color were the makeup on these girls, which was bright red with lipstick and their faces were heavily powdered. The benches in the courtroom were blond wood and dark wood. The furnishings of the houseboat were rather gaudy, some like a, just like an apartment you'd expect to see in a Rock Hudson-Doris Day movie.  Day residue: I had just read an article in Time Magazine about a new means of constructing a courtroom, a picture of it, which is not so much like the one I saw in the dream, but this courtroom was older style. The subject Ben has told me that a number of his dreams, almost all of his dreams were, involved a chase of some kind. I had just been talking of Bill for quite a while yesterday and about our friendship.",

         "I am in a neighborhood, where all the houses are different and they're all old, and really interesting-looking - there's a lot of green, tall, overarching trees - you can barely see the sunlight. It's really gorgeous. I am looking for a house, and I think I know what street it's on, but I'm not exactly sure which - I know which street it's on, I'm not exactly sure where the street is placed in this little area here. If I can find it, I know what it looks like. There is a large, mean, dog in the area; I'm wanting to avoid it, but I can't be sure exactly where it is, because of not knowing which street is which. I seem to be walking, but part of the time I'm riding, because my mind is telling me all these things about how I'm gonna handle this dog business - I am afraid it's just going to come up and rip me to shreds, is the main thing - another is that I can handle this - this is what I keep telling myself; the dog will not necessarily attack me, even though it may bark a lot, especially if I am riding on this vehicle - this may be enough to keep it from coming too close to me. It's not inside of a car, by the way, it's more like being in a jeep or something where I am exposed, but there is a moving vehicle under me. I think about the mastery that some people have over dogs and animals, whereby if you retain confidence and show them that you are not afraid and you order them to stop, or sit, or something like that, they'll stop attacking you, which is nice. Basically I haven't run into this dog yet, and I've come to the end of the street, where there's a cross-street, and decided to turn left, because I think the street I want may be parallel to the left and I go a couple of streets further and find that I'm coming to another dead end where it makes a right angle with the last street of this part, and that's definitely not it, I know that one is not it, especially since I can see the building at the end of the street, which is not a house - maybe a hotel, something like that - small place, and I know that I must be going in the wrong direction, so I turn around. But while I'm there I run into somebody that I know - friend of mine, I guess, who's with somebody else who's got a couple of big dogs - this is not the mean dog - I should call these mastiffs, or something that size that type, very big, stolid, dogs, and this person is not necessarily Dirk, but is like Dirk - he's just gonna ramble on here, as I join them to walk the other direction, and I listen to him go on and on about how these dogs are going to make his living - in hunting, in some capacity. I don't really know in my own mind while I'm there, where it is he means to hunt them, or what precisely he means to hunt - I think it's a fur-bearing animal - that seems to be the upshot of it - but while I'm listening to him go on about this I'm thinking, this is ridiculous, get yourself a real job, these dogs don't want to do all this for you - and he's talking as if these dogs are real \"killers\", _____ dogs, tough dogs, and I'm thinking, this is pitiful - they just want to be petted! They're really nice-looking dogs - I think they might be fun to have around, they don't look like they mean to be tough at all. I'm thinking about getting an opportunity to pet one of 'em - the great big black _____ thing that's walking next to me, actually. Frankly, I'm getting a little bit bored doing this in the first place, and I have got my own place to get to. So I sort of duck away from them after a while. However, before I do that, we have turned right and gone down one of these streets - having not found the house that I was looking for on it - this hotel seems to be where the business district starts right away, and the opposite side of it is more nearly city street. We have come through the kitchen, where there is this counter-thing running along where some cooks are working, it's a butcher-block type of thing, and I know that they cut meat and whatnot there, and prepare a lot of food. We have come up to this, and they're asking questions, like directions, or information, and I'm just waiting there. I've got this binder in my hands - in my arms, actually, a small stack of things - notebooks, etc. - and I lay them on the counter - as it were, you have your arms crossed in front of you holding these things, and just to rest my arms, I lay them on the counter, and then a minute later I snatch them up again, realizing, \"Oh hell, these things have got germs on them and this is a food preparation area - somebody's food's gonna be contaminated with this stuff, whatever it may be.\" I'm really quite embarrassed about that - nobody has noticed it particularly or said not to do that, but I'm wanting to clean it off so that everything will be ok again, and they're still talking. This is where we part company, the guys with the dogs, and I'm gonna go on through the hotel here. I'm looking for Arsenio Hall - I'm supposed to have a visit with him. Maybe it's an interview (though I don't know what I would be interviewing him for), and I'm supposed to meet him somewhere - and the fact is that I run into him in the front hallway. This front hallway is kind of like a lot of little hotels that I went to in England. It's certainly no big flashy hotel - it's got this comfortable little lobby and a tiny service desk, and he is out there. I'm guessing he's staying here, and has just come down to do something at the desk. There's another person there, probably the desk clerk (or someone else associated with the hotel), and they're just chatting. It's night now, in this hotel, and there's this laid-back sort of attitude going on, where you just sort of stand around and chat. So, since I have run into him, I'm telling him what it is that I want, and we fix up that he's going to come along to the house that I'm staying at overnight, and visit with me there after a while. So I go out the front door, down some steps, and then I come to the house I'm staying at, which is my grandmother's house. (It's not the real Bigmama's house on Vanderbilt, but the street is something like it, and the house something like hers, only my grandmother is really like Grandmom, and later on that is exactly what I call her.) She is old - not especially decrepit - and forgetful and a little silly, maybe, but not helpless by any means - slow. We're upstairs, she's dithering over something or other, and I'm just helping her do something, and chatting. The reason I'm here, I think, is maybe because it's convenient for me to do something else, being here. I'm living in the apartment I have now, very satisfactorily, and I don't think that I'm in Grandmom's house just to help out - I think it's something to do with me. Now my brother comes along, and he has got a deal to say on the subject of Grandmom and me and the situation. She's gone downstairs, and he is telling me that I am going to have to move in here and take care of her. Apparently they have got this all worked out (\"they\" being my other relatives, such as they may be), and I guess there's even a lawyer involved, that they've fixed this all up, that I'm to move in here, and take care of things because she is no longer able to take care of herself. Which is what they say. And I'm going along with this for a bit, feeling sad about it, and hurt, without really paying any attention to it. Until it dawns upon me a few minutes later, \"Wait a minute! Num - ber - one: I don't WANT to move in here! I have my own place; that is where I live; I want to live there; I like it; I have my life there, and I don't wanta move in here, and I don't see why you should tell me to do that. Number two: I don't even see how come she needs to be taken care of so bad. I don't think she's done anything all that drastically bad, maybe you think that she needs help, and that's all very well, but why do you think you need to tell me to do this?

         "Interpret this dream: I am in a neighborhood, where all the houses are different and they're all old, and really interesting-looking - there's a lot of green, tall, overarching trees - you can barely see the sunlight. It's really gorgeous. I am looking for a house, and I think I know what street it's on, but I'm not exactly sure which - I know which street it's on, I'm not exactly sure where the street is placed in this little area here. If I can find it, I know what it looks like. There is a large, mean, dog in the area; I'm wanting to avoid it, but I can't be sure exactly where it is, because of not knowing which street is which. I seem to be walking, but part of the time I'm riding, because my mind is telling me all these things about how I'm gonna handle this dog business - I am afraid it's just going to come up and rip me to shreds, is the main thing - another is that I can handle this - this is what I keep telling myself; the dog will not necessarily attack me, even though it may bark a lot, especially if I am riding on this vehicle - this may be enough to keep it from coming too close to me. It's not inside of a car, by the way, it's more like being in a jeep or something where I am exposed, but there is a moving vehicle under me. I think about the mastery that some people have over dogs and animals, whereby if you retain confidence and show them that you are not afraid and you order them to stop, or sit, or something like that, they'll stop attacking you, which is nice. Basically I haven't run into this dog yet, and I've come to the end of the street, where there's a cross-street, and decided to turn left, because I think the street I want may be parallel to the left and I go a couple of streets further and find that I'm coming to another dead end where it makes a right angle with the last street of this part, and that's definitely not it, I know that one is not it, especially since I can see the building at the end of the street, which is not a house - maybe a hotel, something like that - small place, and I know that I must be going in the wrong direction, so I turn around. But while I'm there I run into somebody that I know - friend of mine, I guess, who's with somebody else who's got a couple of big dogs - this is not the mean dog - I should call these mastiffs, or something that size that type, very big, stolid, dogs, and this person is not necessarily Dirk, but is like Dirk - he's just gonna ramble on here, as I join them to walk the other direction, and I listen to him go on and on about how these dogs are going to make his living - in hunting, in some capacity. I don't really know in my own mind while I'm there, where it is he means to hunt them, or what precisely he means to hunt - I think it's a fur-bearing animal - that seems to be the upshot of it - but while I'm listening to him go on about this I'm thinking, this is ridiculous, get yourself a real job, these dogs don't want to do all this for you - and he's talking as if these dogs are real \"killers\", _____ dogs, tough dogs, and I'm thinking, this is pitiful - they just want to be petted! They're really nice-looking dogs - I think they might be fun to have around, they don't look like they mean to be tough at all. I'm thinking about getting an opportunity to pet one of 'em - the great big black _____ thing that's walking next to me, actually. Frankly, I'm getting a little bit bored doing this in the first place, and I have got my own place to get to. So I sort of duck away from them after a while. However, before I do that, we have turned right and gone down one of these streets - having not found the house that I was looking for on it - this hotel seems to be where the business district starts right away, and the opposite side of it is more nearly city street. We have come through the kitchen, where there is this counter-thing running along where some cooks are working, it's a butcher-block type of thing, and I know that they cut meat and whatnot there, and prepare a lot of food. We have come up to this, and they're asking questions, like directions, or information, and I'm just waiting there. I've got this binder in my hands - in my arms, actually, a small stack of things - notebooks, etc. - and I lay them on the counter - as it were, you have your arms crossed in front of you holding these things, and just to rest my arms, I lay them on the counter, and then a minute later I snatch them up again, realizing, \"Oh hell, these things have got germs on them and this is a food preparation area - somebody's food's gonna be contaminated with this stuff, whatever it may be.\" I'm really quite embarrassed about that - nobody has noticed it particularly or said not to do that, but I'm wanting to clean it off so that everything will be ok again, and they're still talking. This is where we part company, the guys with the dogs, and I'm gonna go on through the hotel here. I'm looking for Arsenio Hall - I'm supposed to have a visit with him. Maybe it's an interview (though I don't know what I would be interviewing him for), and I'm supposed to meet him somewhere - and the fact is that I run into him in the front hallway. This front hallway is kind of like a lot of little hotels that I went to in England. It's certainly no big flashy hotel - it's got this comfortable little lobby and a tiny service desk, and he is out there. I'm guessing he's staying here, and has just come down to do something at the desk. There's another person there, probably the desk clerk (or someone else associated with the hotel), and they're just chatting. It's night now, in this hotel, and there's this laid-back sort of attitude going on, where you just sort of stand around and chat. So, since I have run into him, I'm telling him what it is that I want, and we fix up that he's going to come along to the house that I'm staying at overnight, and visit with me there after a while. So I go out the front door, down some steps, and then I come to the house I'm staying at, which is my grandmother's house. (It's not the real Bigmama's house on Vanderbilt, but the street is something like it, and the house something like hers, only my grandmother is really like Grandmom, and later on that is exactly what I call her.) She is old - not especially decrepit - and forgetful and a little silly, maybe, but not helpless by any means - slow. We're upstairs, she's dithering over something or other, and I'm just helping her do something, and chatting. The reason I'm here, I think, is maybe because it's convenient for me to do something else, being here. I'm living in the apartment I have now, very satisfactorily, and I don't think that I'm in Grandmom's house just to help out - I think it's something to do with me. Now my brother comes along, and he has got a deal to say on the subject of Grandmom and me and the situation. She's gone downstairs, and he is telling me that I am going to have to move in here and take care of her. Apparently they have got this all worked out (\"they\" being my other relatives, such as they may be), and I guess there's even a lawyer involved, that they've fixed this all up, that I'm to move in here, and take care of things because she is no longer able to take care of herself. Which is what they say. And I'm going along with this for a bit, feeling sad about it, and hurt, without really paying any attention to it. Until it dawns upon me a few minutes later, \"Wait a minute! Num - ber - one: I don't WANT to move in here! I have my own place; that is where I live; I want to live there; I like it; I have my life there, and I don't wanta move in here, and I don't see why you should tell me to do that. Number two: I don't even see how come she needs to be taken care of so bad. I don't think she's done anything all that drastically bad, maybe you think that she needs help, and that's all very well, but why do you think you need to tell me to do this? Number Three: I have you, and a cousin (and maybe another brother or sister or two - but I don't know - it's in my mind there's other siblings here), and just what is wrong with any of you coming to live here? What do you think it has to be me for? And I'm not gonna do it! How's that?\" He seems to be a bit disappointed, and to think that this is an idle protest, and it's not gonna do me any good at all, because it's a done deal - of course I'm gonna do this.

         "There is a previous part to the dream which I do not remember. The part I do remember began at night. It took place in the city of Camden, N.J., my home town. I was driving a lightweight Honda motorcycle. It was the lightest one they made. The purpose of what I was driving to, my friend Bill's house which was outside the city of Camden where I was to meet with him and another friend of ours for dinner. It seems to have had something to do with the previous part of the dream in that I had been talking with Bill and this other friend of ours about the arrangements for dinner. I'm not completely certain of that. At any rate, I was driving around and getting very aggravated because I was beginning to get lost. After a while I believe I asked someone for directions and they gave them to me, and without too much help I got lost again. About I did finally end up near a street that was vaguely familiar. At this point I ran into Bill's brother who was somehow there. For some reason or other he was there. I told him what I was doing and would he please tell me how to get back to his house. For some reason or other he said, \"I'm not certain,\" or something like that. I said, \"Well now, isn't this street here the one-way street that leads into the bridge and the street beyond it the street that leads out from the bridge?\" This bridge being the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. He said, \"No, no, it doesn't work like that.\" There was a friend with him who agreed and I said, \"Well no, you're wrong. It's absolutely true that is the one-way street that leads to the bridge and the other one leads away from the bridge.\" The more we argued about this, the more surprised I was that they didn't agree with me because this was an absolute fact. Somehow or another we finally parted company and I proceeded on my way. As I proceeded, I came upon a street that is just slightly within the, or slightly beyond the area of the toll gates o the bridge, but nevertheless you can take this tiny road that leads past the toll gate without paying toll because they realize that this is still within the city limits of Camden. It's a very narrow winding little road, but as I began to take it, somehow or other it was beginning to be daylight and a group of boys on bicycles began to more or less get in front of me, on the side of me and behind me, and I became surrounded, enmeshed in this group of cyclists. Finally we got through this street and came upon a street corner on which there was a store, I believe, and all these cyclists began to park their cycles and I became entrapped and unable to get out. As I tried to ply my way through on foot pushing my motor scooter, which I believe had a blue gas tank, I just began to get very frustrated. There were so many of them and they were parking their bikes so close that I couldn't seem to wade my way through. They were all French, the boys. Finally after making some slight headway, I came upon a person who seemed to be in charge. I made conversation and as it turned out, these were a group of young boys from France and this was their commander who was actually in charge of a private school. These being the students of that school and they were on a bicycle tour of the United States. Somehow I thought it would be the perfect thing to do to engage him in a short conversation in spite of the fact that I did want to get away and get off to meet my friends for dinner. He was bald-headed and reminded me of the candidate for Governor in California, Al Cranston, in appearance. He began to tell me about this school, and he also introduced me to his second in command, a younger man, but still considerably older than the others. He was about my age. He was his right hand man, so to speak. This young man, it's not too clear except that he was very hairy and yet it was still obvious that even though he was hairy that he had acne over his chest. Then the commander, the leader of the group, told me that he used to run a military school in which he was the commander and his right hand man had been what you would call a commander's commander, but he meant this as a lower echelon position, not as a higher one. He told me that he did not run it any longer as a military school. The reasons were not quite clear as to why he had made this change. Nevertheless, we continued this conversation and I was getting quite aggravated in a way and I was being polite. Then there seemed to be a slight change of scene. Inasmuch as I wanted to get rid of this fellow after a while, this slight change apparently provided the opportunity because all of a sudden I was in the presence of Dr. Hall, and this gentleman, Monsieur something or other, began with a D, he and Dr. Hall became engaged in conversation. Dr. Hall asked me, \"Do you know any of the other guys?\" and he said, I forget his answer. Then they began to talk about Europe and made references to various places to which they had both been or were familiar with. Then Dr. Hall said something, \"Well you can speak any one of the 16 languages that you speak,\" and he said, \"Yes, it's true, but I don't usually.\" At any rather they continued in this conversation, and it wasn't long thereafter that the dream ended. Throughout this dream there were a couple of times when I had difficulty in shifting the gears of this Honda. They were three or our gears, I forget which, but I was quite angry because a couple of times they seemed to just lock and I couldn't shift them. So I would have to push them, push the motorcycle. The motorcycle was of such a nature that it could have been their biggest motorbike or their lightest motorcycle. It's rather hard to believe. The roadway through which I had to go to get beyond the toll area of the bridge, one small section of it was cast in a red light or actually painted red. That is the roadway in the curves. As I was talking with the commander a little earlier in the dream, I was wondering, although I think this was just before I woke up and as I was talking with Dr. Hall. I was thinking what a shame he and his boys couldn't see the, or I felt hadn't seen the west because if they were traveling around the country on bicycles, it didn't seem right that they could cycle quite that far. I presumed that they might just cover some of the eastern states. I was thinking of all the things I could say to them about how beautiful the west was and how unusual and how different from the east. He wouldn't have seen a true representative, a picture of the United States unless he actually had been there out west. What else strikes me as I was getting frustrated and trying to wend my way through this multitude and bikes being parked around this store, all these boys despite blocking me in were very polite and very courteous. I would say these boys ranged in age from about 12-17 perhaps. I recall they were mostly dressed in white. I think most of the bicycles were white. The strange part of this dream is that I'm quite familiar with the city of Camden and even at night it would be a very rare thing for me to get lost, although I do not know all the names of the main streets throughout the whole city, I can easily find my way, and it would be most unusual, especially in the area in which I finally ended up, that I would become lost. Another strange thing was the argument that I had with Bill's brother and his friend that there were these two specific roads leading to and from the bridge. In fact, they really are, and they were maintaining that this was not so. Even though this dream took place in Camden, N.J. and seemed to be in, slightly in the past, the fact that all of a sudden the leader was engaged in conversation with Dr. Hall did not appear strange to me. The notion that I was riding a Honda is perhaps due to the advertisement on the radio that I constantly hear, the tune of which I actually like. The whole way the advertisement is done I've thought about it as being well done. This group of cyclists, there is nothing that's happened in the last day or two, but however quite a while ago having read, as a matter of fact, it was in the city of Philadelphia. Yes, I recall cycling about the city and they were from Europe, and I actually saw them one day cycling through the center of the city. It must have been a group of about twenty of them. They were from France. It was a rather impressive sight because it was something you don't often see in Philadelphia. Their commander appeared like Alan Cranston, I guess it was just due to the fact that I've read about him recently in the papers, and I was surprised to read that he's a stronger candidate than I had originally anticipated he would be inasmuch as Pierre Salinger has actually lost ground to Cranston, and just the reversal would probably be true.",

         "One part that comes back was standing in a hallway or rather alleyway of a large auditorium. The word I want is aisle of a large auditorium. In the auditorium were a large number of prominent people who were all seated there on wooden seats. In some ways it seems as if this was set out of doors, but I'm not certain of that. It seems I had just walked over toward the aisle and was pulling a piece of tape off of my throat. I had some difficulty doing this, and after I took the tape off, I looked at it and it was the same flesh-colored tape we use here, except part of it was completely transparent like Scotch tape, and I wondered if the flesh-colored part had still adhered to my throat or Adam's apple. It seemed that Jimmy Durante had just got up and had to leave the theater in a hurry, and then someone was saying that if they could be anybody in the whole world, they would like to be Jimmy Durante because he was such a  fine person and so well loved. Then I looked throughout the audience and it seemed as if Cary Grant were there, and I was imagining someone probably saying that they would like to be Cary Grant if they could be anybody in the world, because of his distinguished good looks and his overall handsomeness. Then I was sort of asking myself who would I want to be. It seemed as if I were wondering if I wanted to be Calvin because of all his scientific productivity and then his theoretical writings, but I don't believe I ever answered the question. The setting was in a basement, I believe, because it involved a cold storage vault. There were a large number of valuable furs in this one room, and I worked there in some capacity. It seems as if there were two shifts of girls involved here because one of the girls was just getting ready to leave. She was a young, attractive sort of red-haired girl, and as she was coming out of this one room of the vault, she said, \"Oh, are you still here?\" I said, \"Yes, you know me. I'm always on the job.\" She then prepared to go home, and she said something to me that I cold not quite understand, and I asked her, \"Did you say A or B or C?\" B referred to alarm clock and A referred to something much more suggestive of sex and C was a completely neutral choice. I said, \"Which of those three things did you say? I have a preference in terms of what I hope you said,\" but it seemed as if she gave the neutral word. Then I said to her, \"Well, maybe someday I'll get to hear your alarm clock,\" and she seemed to be slightly embarrassed by what I had said. Then it seemed as if there were some other man in the vault with me, and he was saying something about I was trying to make time, and I said, yes, I didn't seem to have gotten very far, but this gal was warming up a little bit. Then some other girl appeared and it seemed as if it were her shift that was now starting. I said something to her about, \"Your accent seems much more southern today than it did yesterday.\" I said something about, \"You really are a you-all type today.\" I believe she mentioned something about having visited with her parents or her in-laws that day and they were very southern, and so this is why she was talking this way now. Then I noticed the coats that were hung along in the storage vault, and I thought that since this was not very large and it was expensive to store things there, that they should make more efficient use of the space than they did. There were several spots that were untidy and things had been sort of scattered about. Somehow this vault seemed connected with sleep research because this first girl seemed to say, \"Are you still going on with the sleeping or dreaming?\" and in that sense it seemed to have some kind of lab aspect to the vault. Then the setting shifted to a top story of an old building. I was talking on the telephone to someone who I believe was named David Peterson. I was trying to write down some information, and it seemed like as I talked to him, I was reminded that I had talked to him earlier and had written down the information that was needed, but I now couldn't find it because the papers were all scattered about and the desk or area nearby was untidy. Then I apologized, saying that I had just gotten up from being a subject. I was kind of fuzzy in my thinking. Then I momentarily felt that this was a bad thing to say because we were thinking of using him as a subject, and this might scare him off if he thought that there were some sort of adverse aftereffects to it. But then it seemed as if he were calling me because he was at the University of Miami and wanted to do a dissertation on dreams, and it was to be on the effect of cold, acids, or cold solutions of some sorts. Then I asked him to repeat the information in terms of where his meeting was to be held and what time. I said that this time I would make sure that I got it written down. He said that it would be held on November 16th, and I said that would be easy enough to remember because it was my birthday. Now what place would it be? He said he wasn't sure, but it seemed like it would be so and so place. Then it seemed as if I was still talking, but the setting shifted very slightly, and I was now standing up with my elbows on some sort of desk, and I was near an open window looking out the window. This fellow started pressuring me about the exam that was to be held about over his dissertation, and he asked how thorough would he have to master the literature. I said he would have to know it very well but we would not ask him specific questions on it like what did Schwartz do in 1957. At this point it seemed as if three girls from my nursing class walked behind me, one in particular who I think her code name is Charlie the Tuna, and they were all laughing over this conversation and seemed to be amazed at the lightness involved and good humor that was being displayed because they did not expect this kind of attitude or conduct from their teachers. They expected a much more harsh disciplinarian. Then I was explaining to this fellow that since he's going to be doing a dissertation at the University of Miami, we certainly expect a competent job to be done, etc., and all I could tell him was we would be asking questions more about his design in terms of why did he use a certain kind of statistic or some other kind, why he had used the controls he had used, and that nobody was out to give him a bad time. If he had a fairly solid design and presented it, that was all there was to it. At this point I looked down below into the street and Alan Sternberg, a student who had also been in therapy with me, was walking by and seemed to be looking up in my direction, and I thought I hadn't seen him in some time and thought that he was looking for me. Then the conversation continued with this student and he finally said, \"So what?\" I just answered him back, \"So what? What do you mean, so what?\" Then it seemed that the setting shifted to the front of this room, and now this student was there in person. He was heavy set with a reddish brush cut and one eye that seemed perhaps to have a glass eye, freckled, timid and not too bright-looking. Here were a couple of other people scattered around. One of them seemed to be the chairman of the department, and I think it was Calvin who was the chairman. I think there were two women present and then some older woman who was in her sixties came in who was explaining about the mail or where her records were kept. I seemed a little unclear on this, and then one of the women said, \"Well, we keep them straight across the hall because the main departmental offices are in another building and because it's difficult to get over there, we have sort of a mail service here in this building.\" Then there was some discussion about how handy it would be when the department had another separate department headquarters in this building. It seemed as if the department were ready to branch out to two divisions, and I agreed that it would certainly be more handy when it was located there. Since I still seemed to be unsure about these records, Calvin sort of nodded and one of the women got up to go over and get the forms or material for me that seemed to be needed. Then the setting shifted again, and Calvin was saying something to me, but he seemed to be demonstrating the point by tapping lightly on my lower abdomen, which was making me annoyed. Then it seemed as if Calvin were in the room here and I was relating a dream to him, and we were having a discussion about dream or something related to it. All of a sudden I heard the EEG machine stop, and I said to him, \"Did you run out of paper, because the machine was just running and now suddenly it's stopped.\" He looked at me and sort of smiled, and said something about, \"Well, you knew that I would take care of everything the way it should be taken care of.\" Then Calvin did walk into the room in reality to awaken me. Estimated time would be about 10 minutes.",

         "Interpret this dream: One part that comes back was standing in a hallway or rather alleyway of a large auditorium. The word I want is aisle of a large auditorium. In the auditorium were a large number of prominent people who were all seated there on wooden seats. In some ways it seems as if this was set out of doors, but I'm not certain of that. It seems I had just walked over toward the aisle and was pulling a piece of tape off of my throat.

         "I'm downtown, waiting for a bus, and I see my neighbors - they're Mexicans, actually a large family, here's the mother and a couple of daughters. We chat, and some others in the family come along, husband I guess, and other sons & daughters. They were just in the vicinity and are going to give the wife et al a lift home. I seem to be excluded, which I think is pretty tacky. They walk along to where the car is, and after a hesitation I tag along, trying to chat with the younger son, who's somewhat retarded and who I have previously had a sort of amiable relationship with. He's dressed up in a suit, rather unusual, and he's not interested in talking to me - in fact, we stop for a bit and as we're facing each other I can see he's looking at me with real hostility. Very strange. I'm disconcerted and figure I better just go on off my merry way. Elsewhere on the street, further up, I'm walking along with my purse firmly clamped under my arm. (It has a shoulder strap, too, but I also have it pinned like a clutch bag for safety. It's taupe, a soft bag, like that one I gave Michelle but smaller.) I feel a tug on it, and turn around to see what's going on. A sleazy-looking little man in an ill-fitting suit has hold of it - he thought he could just snatch it, apparently, and since I have it firmly he didn't get it. He looks at me menacingly, as if I'd better let go of the thing or I'd be sorry, and I pull back on it again, very indignant. Neither of us makes a sound. I'm not anxious to cause a scene if he'll just let go, maybe he'll think twice about purse-snatching again. He apparently just wants me to be intimidated into letting him have it because he could hurt me - indeed, he starts to reach into his jacket for something, making an expression that's supposed to be warning me - I guess he's got a gun or a knife, but I'm not going for it, not yet anyway. There's lots of people around, he could hardly get away with it - though at the same time I realize he probably could, the way things are today. I'm worried about that sort of thing. Still, I yank on my purse before he can reach whatever it is, and get it free. I hustle on ahead. It goes through my mind that I ought to hold my purse further forward to make it harder for somebody to grab from behind, then I picture myself always carrying my purse (and whatever) clutched tightly to my chest like I'm paranoid, then I picture everybody, all the people going up and down the street, carrying their stuff like that, all holding on for dear life. Ludicrous, really. Oh well. I stop to tell a policeman, who's standing a bit further up the street, what happened, but he's not interested. I go on to this hotel-apartment house that I'm (staying?) in. [It looks like a lot of places I've seen in England - long hallways, old-looking but solid, very well kept, plain, dark wood stair-rails, etc.) This man runs it [he has a bit of Jerry Haynes and Walter Pidgeon in him] and we're trying to hide Elvis Presley. I'm a sort of companion, although there are some others involved in this effort, and we've come to this man as a contact who will help hide Elvis and get him away. The man is rather on the suspicious side himself, though - rather odd, a dapper little guy with a silly little mustache, cryptic, secretive. I'm not comfortable with him. I meet them in \"our\" room, and put my things down, coat over the back of the couch, etc., and we go down the hall a few yards, up a few steps and around a corner to another room. The man leaves, we're to wait. I think about my purse again after a few minutes, realizing it's just sitting on the back of the couch, very noticeable, and we didn't shut the door - there's nobody about, the place might be deserted except for us, but I'm worried. I know I shouldn't leave Elvis alone, but I get antsy, and after a few more minutes I decide it'll be okay to just dash back to the room and fix it. I look all down the hall - there's nobody to be seen, no sounds - and I go. My purse is there, but as I pick it up it seems to feel different, lighter, like something's missing. I check briefly, but it seems okay - checkbook's there, that would be the biggest thing. Don't know, maybe it's lighter because I had something in it earlier that usually isn't, oh well. I take it back with me to the other room. Elvis isn't there. Uh-oh. I look all over for him - this is a kind of suite, it has a kitchen and living area - an efficiency apartment? No Elvis. The man comes back, some other people too, one of whom is a girlfriend of mine. We discuss the matter, and divide up. Somebody goes out, the man gets on the phone. It's also getting on for dinnertime, and we're cooking something. I figure we want some cinnamon for this dish we've got going, and I think of a plant that's in the back of the room near the window. It has little leaves on it that [either are cinnamon, or taste like it], and I start to pick some off. I look out the window casually, and am surprised to see a dog lying on the grass. What's in back of this (house) is mostly trees, a little bit of yard, and a little railroad track. It's dark, and what light there is, is coming from here through the window. This dog looks funny, and I suddenly see blood on its head and I realize it's been hit (presumably by a train). It looks dead. Yuck. But as I watch, it moves - it was just hurt. It lifts its head up and shifts around, and I now realize it's not even a dog - I guess - maybe it is, but it's beginning to look like an elephant. That's very weird. I'm getting very confused, watching it. I realize that if it's an elephant, it must be a baby, if I mistook it for a dog. Geez. I suppose I'd better tell somebody about this, but I'm not sure I'm not hallucinating either. Wow. I go back into the room and mean to give the leaves to my friend for the pot, but before I do she shows me she found some old cinnamon somewhere and she's all ready to use that. I don't mention my leaves, though I feel rather shot down - it's amazing how \"little\" I feel, as if I were a little kid who'd been slighted by her parents. So I just poo-poo myself and carry on. We go into the dining room [this place has gotten bigger, you see] and we're talking. There's a dining table lengthwise in the room, a window at the end with filmy drapes, and just the daylight through them, so the room's in shadow. There's a chair or two away from the table, standing between us, having just come in the door, and the space next to the table. On the other side (in that space) is a very large papier-mache black bird. I don't know what it's for - though maybe it's something to do with an upcoming party the man's having - but I look at it briefly, it's rather neat. It moves, and at first I'm surprised but realize it's probably just tipped over, vibrated off balance. But then it moves again, and I'm sure it's done it on purpose. I say, \"Stop that\" as if it's alive, thinking how silly I sound, and remark to my girlfriend that I'm sure I saw it move. I go around the chair to get in front of it, as it's moved toward the table, and I squat down facing it. When I do, I realize it's actually a cat, not a bird; how could I have mistaken it for a bird? Strange. And it's very cunning, this thing. It doesn't quite look like papier-mache any more, it's got fur - and I notice two extra eyes looking at me, hidden in the black fur above the fake eyes. I stare for a minute, then realize what I'm seeing - by George, it's Elvis! This is a disguise! I tell my girlfriend to come see, and at first she doesn't either - this is really good! I explain to her what this is, and first she says, oh, pshaw, something like that. But then she sees, too, and is also dumbfounded. There are two blue eyes peeping through that fur! I don't know how he got in this outfit that fast, but it sure is a good way to hide. I suspect that the man has something to do with this, but I don't know.",

I look all down the hall - there's nobody to be seen, no sounds - and I go. My purse is there, but as I pick it up it seems to feel different, lighter, like something's missing. I check briefly, but it seems okay - checkbook's there, that would be the biggest thing. Don't know, maybe it's lighter because I had something in it earlier that usually isn't, oh well. I take it back with me to the other room. Elvis isn't there. Uh-oh. I look all over for him - this is a kind of suite, it has a kitchen and living area - an efficiency apartment? No Elvis. The man comes back, some other people too, one of whom is a girlfriend of mine. We discuss the matter, and divide up. Somebody goes out, the man gets on the phone. It's also getting on for dinnertime, and we're cooking something. I figure we want some cinnamon for this dish we've got going, and I think of a plant that's in the back of the room near the window. It has little leaves on it that [either are cinnamon, or taste like it], and I start to pick some off. I look out the window casually, and am surprised to see a dog lying on the grass. What's in back of this (house) is mostly trees, a little bit of yard, and a little railroad track. It's dark, and what light there is, is coming from here through the window. This dog looks funny, and I suddenly see blood on its head and I realize it's been hit (presumably by a train). It looks dead. Yuck. But as I watch, it moves - it was just hurt. It lifts its head up and shifts around, and I now realize it's not even a dog - I guess - maybe it is, but it's beginning to look like an elephant. That's very weird. I'm getting very confused, watching it. I realize that if it's an elephant, it must be a baby, if I mistook it for a dog. Geez. I suppose I'd better tell somebody about this, but I'm not sure I'm not hallucinating either. Wow. I go back into the room and mean to give the leaves to my friend for the pot, but before I do she shows me she found some old cinnamon somewhere and she's all ready to use that. I don't mention my leaves, though I feel rather shot down - it's amazing how \"little\" I feel, as if I were a little kid who'd been slighted by her parents. So I just poo-poo myself and carry on. We go into the dining room [this place has gotten bigger, you see] and we're talking. There's a dining table lengthwise in the room, a window at the end with filmy drapes, and just the daylight through them, so the room's in shadow. There's a chair or two away from the table, standing between us, having just come in the door, and the space next to the table. On the other side (in that space) is a very large papier-mache black bird. I don't know what it's for - though maybe it's something to do with an upcoming party the man's having - but I look at it briefly, it's rather neat. It moves, and at first I'm surprised but realize it's probably just tipped over, vibrated off balance. But then it moves again, and I'm sure it's done it on purpose. I say, \"Stop that\" as if it's alive, thinking how silly I sound, and remark to my girlfriend that I'm sure I saw it move. I go around the chair to get in front of it, as it's moved toward the table, and I squat down facing it. When I do, I realize it's actually a cat, not a bird; how could I have mistaken it for a bird? Strange. And it's very cunning, this thing. It doesn't quite look like papier-mache any more, it's got fur - and I notice two extra eyes looking at me, hidden in the black fur above the fake eyes. I stare for a minute, then realize what I'm seeing - by George, it's Elvis! This is a disguise! I tell my girlfriend to come see, and at first she doesn't either - this is really good! I explain to her what this is, and first she says, oh, pshaw, something like that. But then she sees, too, and is also dumbfounded. There are two blue eyes peeping through that fur! I don't know how he got in this outfit that fast, but it sure is a good way to hide. I suspect that the man has something to do with this, but I don't know.\nSymbols: - Clothing: If you are wearing inappropriate clothes for a situation, then it means that you are unprepared for the task at hand.\n - Defend: Dreaming that someone is defending you or standing up for you symbolizes your sense of self-worth.\n - Disrespect: Dreaming that you are being disrespectful indicate guilt about your actions or behavior.

         "I was walking around the city of the city where I live. I went into 8 or 10 different buildings. To enter each one I had to climb a steep, high flight of stairs. Each flight of steps was very unusual. Some of the flights either seemed to be or actually were built higher than the typical twelve inches. At first glance, at the first two or three flights, I was a bit hesitant, wondering about the safety and if I would be able to climb them without falling or getting hurt. At some of the buildings there was someone at the top watching and saying something to me about the steps, in some cases telling me to be careful or saying that they really aren't that bad if you're just careful. In most cases each of the steps was partially rounded and open. The best description I can think of is the shape of the end of a medicine capsule, only partial. The rounded end was there and the bottom extended a bit further than the top part. In some cases the rounded end faced out and I had to step over the rounded end and into each step. In other cases they faced the other way and I had to step into each one. In most cases each step seemed to protrude a bit over the step below making me feel that I needed to be extra cautious. At least some of them also seemed that each step was slanted. down towards the back of the step. It's as though I had to step into each step, sometimes over and into. The steps were also very colors, some with a marble appearance in dark colors, other were white. None of them looked like typical steps in materials or colors that you would typically see. The last building I entered the steps led down into the building, though they were equally unusual. This flight had more of a feel of climbing down a rung ladder, though it seemed more sturdy than that. I would typically feel a little nervous about climbing down a tall, steep, rung ladder but I felt pretty confident about this one. The steps were white and the entryway seemed very well lit, bright and welcoming. An employee of the store was standing at the bottom cautioning me. This was a business that people bought memberships to frequent. They offered all types of audios that people could come in and listen to, but the audios could not be taken from the premises. Each room had comfortable seating for patrons to sit and listen to the audios. It was made up of numerous average-size rooms. Each room had a different topic of audios. There was something unusual about these audios, though I'm having trouble putting my finger on exactly what it is. One thing is that weren't made in any kind of format that we're used to seeing, CD, cassette, LP album. As I looked at the displays I noticed there seemed to be two or three different formats. Some did look similar to an LP album. Others were smaller, thicker square packages, but not like a CD or cassette. The topics were primarily not ones that you would find on audio. I think some of them, maybe most of them, were educational in nature. maybe audio books. When I entered some of the rooms I knew immediately I didn't want to listen to anything from that category and quickly left the room, sometimes not going further than to peer in or step into the room to see what the topic was. A woman that I know was there, though I don't know her in waking life, with her child. I thinking a daughter. We talked a bit about this business. I told her I had not known about it before now and I just happened upon it. I came into the building just to see what was here. I was very interested and happy to have found it, but disappointed that I had not found it before. I thought that there were probably few people who knew it existed. It seems that there is also a man there that I know, again I don't know him in waking life. On and off, I'm talking to each of them at separate times. One of them tells me about the membership. There is a small, rectangular, window-like opening along one wall. The opening has glass, or plexiglas part way down from the top, leaving an opening between the bottom of the glass and the lower sill of the window opening. The lower sill has a dark brown, wood shelf, about 12 inches deep and maybe 1 inch thick. There is a male employee behind the window and uses the opening to talk to members and potential members, or to pass documents back and forth. I go to talk to him, to get more information about membership. He tells me what paperwork he needs from me to be able to complete the application and I as I go through my purse I realize I don't have the information with me that he needs. He suggests a temporary membership and that I can bring the other information with me the next time. I'm still not sure what the cost of the membership is or if I should be spending my money on it right now. I'm trying to decide if this is something that I just want or if it will really be helpful to me right now. Now I'm talking to Jane C. We're talking a bit about my whole CAS experience. It seems that she sees things more from my perspective than Bill C's. I feel that she is definitely sympathetic and supportive of me. She is getting ready to leave and I ask her to wait just a second and I will walk out with her. I want to continue talking with her. At first she hesitates because she is meeting someone outside. I tell her it will really only be a second so she decides to wait. We have to climb back up to leave the building. This time the entry/exit seems darker than when I came in, though I don't think I noticed this in the dream itself. As we got outside Jane C began looking for her friend. At first she started to walk away thinking she would track her down but then she decided to stay for a bit. I'm facing many different streets, some running parallel to each other and others going off at angles in different directions. I can see down each street from where I am standing. I'm trying to remember where I parked my car, as I had been walking most of the day. I'm not sure I remember, and where I'm thinking it may be is quite far away and I'm feeling dismayed about having to walk that much further yet, to get to my car. The street running perpendicular to me is now somewhat rounded and has three or more lanes of traffic all heading in the same direction. heading to my right. The traffic becomes bumper to bumper just as the cars get in front of me. There are a couple of times that someone nearly gets rear-ended because someone is driving too fast and not paying attention. I realize that I need to cross this street to head towards my car and there is no crosswalk in sight. I'm standing there debating what to do. whether or not to try to cross this street in the midst of all this traffic. I see my brother Bob F drive up in a very funny, little, white vehicle. It's not a car really. It's something that he uses with his job at the park. At first I thought I could ask him to drive me to my car. Then I'm not sure I can get to him as he is in one of the middle lanes of traffic. I finally decide to at least get his attention. I call out to him two or three times before he hears me. He finally looks my way and I make a dash to his vehicle. As soon as I reach him I realize there isn't room for a second person, but he immediately pushes something behind him over and tells me to get on. It's a very small space. I would have to sit facing from the side of the vehicle with my legs dangling. I wasn't even sure I could fit in there. It was covered with some kind of delicate, pink fabric. There are some pearls similar lying on it or near it or under the fabric. I hesitate to sit. He needs to take off so I tell him I will just stand on the sideboard and hang on. The traffic is slow enough that I won't be in danger. So he takes off. There is now bumper-to-bumper traffic as far as I can see in every direction. There are also tons of people milling around. I realize that there is going to be a parade starting soon. I think I would enjoy watching it but contemplate trying to get to my car before it starts and watching it from there, rather than waiting until afterwards to walk all the way to my car. There are groups of young musicians standing around waiting to match in the parade. all dressed in bright, colorful uniforms. There are also a lot of buses parked everywhere. I suppose they transported the young musicians to the parade location. The buses have an almost graffiti like appearance to them. Most of them being a dark blue base paint with white graffiti. I'm trying to decide if it would be safe to walk between these parked buses, as the view from any one point would be so limited.",

         "In this dream my sex keeps changing and I'll try to keep track of it, but I don't think I recall. The first part of it that I remember I'm up in the mountains at what seems to be my parents-in-law's cabin except it's not exactly like it and it had a dirt floor. It had all sorts of leaves and stuff over it. It's as if it used to be a church and that there used to be witchcraft practice at it I've been trying to practice some kind of witchcraft from which I've dug up all sorts of things from the floor of this birch cabin, but I decide they're not powerful enough, that they are too old and they should be left here to protect the place or something. So I buried them again and my identity seems to shift and it was as if some old woman had been practicing this stuff and then buried it again, and she's been arguing with my wife's parents that they should put a wooden floor in the cabin. I don't think they know why, but her reason was to make sure nobody would dig up this stuff again. So then the scene shifts and I'm myself again, but I'm not particularly aware of it. We're in the city again and we're trying to get rid of anything involved in magical preparations which were left from this witch's activities. The main thing that's left is a black cape. Now this cape in the dream is really just a big square piece of black cloth. It's very similar to a piece of black cloth I had as a child that I used to pretend was a cape and had various fantasies about being a magician or a vampire. I used to use it as a Halloween costume. This black cloth gradually changes in the dream such that it becomes a raggedy old fur coat, and it's important to burn this old fur coat in order to get rid of any influences of the witch. So I and a number of other people -- I don't know who these are -- are trying to burn it and I try to light the coat directly, and it won't burn very well. It flickered for a bit and then would go out. The fur doesn't seem to catch at all So then we set it up on a framework with a pile of leaves underneath. All this time we're in sort of an alley between two brick buildings. So we set fire to these leaves and things piled underneath, and then I get a whole bunch of big photographs, 4 x 6 prints, to throw in the fire to help it burn. These photographs have come from the student newspaper on campus, and are extras from their files. I'm looking thru these photographs as I throw them in and occasionally pulling out one that I don't want to burn. One of the first ones I pulled out had a picture of a very nice girl with no clothes on, so I decide to save that. Then I seem to pull out several that seem to be photographs made of me when I was a young child. I can't recall now what I was doing in these photographs, but I recognized them at the time as photographs taken of me which I hadn't seen in years. Well anyway, I saved some of these photographs, threw others into the fire, trying to make the coat burn, and the coat still wouldn't burn at all to speak of. Then I went off and did something and the place where we were burning the coat was sort of the student newspaper, I think. I noticed someone from the newspaper, a man, had picked up the photographs I had put aside to save and was filing them away in their files. I argued with him about this, that these were my photographs. He said no, they were the paper's, and I argued that they had thrown them out and I wanted to save those and they were mine anyway. He would have none of this argument and continued putting them back in the files, so I went out in anger and told him that the curse would probably fall on them because they interfered with burning the coat. I don't know yet if the coat managed to burn or not. I suspect not. Now my sex seemed to change and I was a young woman. I went up several flights of stairs to my apartment, which I apparently shared with this old woman who was a witch. I was very ambivalent about what I had done. I was glad to get rid of her and yet afraid of having burned her things and gotten rid of her. I don't know how I had gotten ride of her, incidentally, but I knew that she was dead. Yet in some ways I kind of missed her because I liked her, so I went into my apartment and was still very mad at the people at the newspaper and so I practiced some kind of spell to bring them bad luck or something. It was as though I was following in the witch's footsteps. And a lot of time passed, although I didn't experience it. And still as the young woman I was having trouble getting jobs and the like because of my connection with the witch. Finally I thought I would have a job as a servant to some woman who lived in one of the apartments downstairs. I went down and knocked at the door and it turned out she just wanted me to babysit for the afternoon while she went out shopping, but I took it anyway. The woman went out and I went into one of the back bedrooms This incident might have happened before this, but I'll describe it as happening now because I'm not sure. I went into one of the back bedrooms, which was only partially lit, and the old witch kind of materialized in the bed, and I was quite frightened, and she was calling my name, which I forget. It was some girl's name, but I don't recall it. Finally she dematerialized again and was gone. I went up to the front of the apartment to take care of the little children. There was a little boy and a little girl, both of them somewhere between 4 and 5, and I had put the children to bed. They were sleeping side by side in a big double bed, and I was telling them to go to bed, and as I was covering them, they both simultaneously became possessed by the witch. I jumped on top of them to hold them still and there was some tendency on their part to disappear and for the body of the witch to take their place. My sex may have been a little bit indeterminate at this point. There were some definite sexual feelings aroused in me by my kneeling over the body of this witch. I think I was trying to keep the body of the witch from materializing and taking over the bodies of these children. Then there follows some confused events which I don't recall clearly, the outcome of which was that I had died. I was a male again, incidentally. I was starting down a road after having died and there was a voice speaking to me from somewhere, and I asked it which road was the road to hell. It told me and told me that it was the one I would have to go down, and the road said something about experiencing again all these experiences of life. So I started down this road, which incidentally looked like a road I drove down yesterday on my way back from a psychiatric convention, but after going down this road a little ways, the voice told me to turn off onto a side road. I did and there was a stream with a little bridge across it, and there was a swing on the bridge, and a young girl in her teens, swinging in it. The voice told me here was an opportunity to redeem myself for having been involved with this witchcraft in my life, that this young girl was going to swing kind of hard in the swing and her father, who was standing on the other side of the bridge, didn't want her to. The girl actually had some suicidal tendencies, and if I could stop her from committing suicide, it would be a good thing for me. So I walked over to the bridge and the girl's father came up behind her. I sat down on the swing beside her. She couldn't see me or touch me or anything because I was dead, and her father told her a couple of other things and that she shouldn't swing so high. She promised him she wouldn't and then her father went off on some kind of business. Then my voice instructed me to see to it that the girl went somewhere and then learned how to make love and then came back here. So I was wondering how I was going to explain to her since she couldn't hear me, and then I began to wonder whether this was a test in itself because I thought at first that I should do exactly what this voice told me, but then I thought if this girl is feeling kind of suicidal and if she goes off and makes love for the first time and then feels guilty afterwards, and then goes off and commits suicide, which is what I'm supposed  to prevent, maybe I was supposed to think for myself and not give unquestioning obedience to this voice. So as I was thinking about this problem, this is about the point where I woke up.",

         "Interpret this dream: In this dream my sex keeps changing and I'll try to keep track of it, but I don't think I recall. The first part of it that I remember I'm up in the mountains at what seems to be my parents-in-law's cabin except it's not exactly like it and it had a dirt floor. It had all sorts of leaves and stuff over it. It's as if it used to be a church and that there used to be witchcraft practice at it I've been trying to practice some kind of witchcraft from which I've dug up all sorts of things from the floor of this birch cabin, but I decide they're not powerful enough, that they are too old and they should be left here to protect the place or something. So I buried them again and my identity seems to shift and it was as if some old woman had been practicing this stuff and then buried it again, and she's been arguing with my wife's parents that they should put a wooden floor in the cabin. I don't think they know why, but her reason was to make sure nobody would dig up this stuff again. So then the scene shifts and I'm myself again, but I'm not particularly aware of it. We're in the city again and we're trying to get rid of anything involved in magical preparations which were left from this witch's activities. The main thing that's left is a black cape. Now this cape in the dream is really just a big square piece of black cloth. It's very similar to a piece of black cloth I had as a child that I used to pretend was a cape and had various fantasies about being a magician or a vampire. I used to use it as a Halloween costume. This black cloth gradually changes in the dream such that it becomes a raggedy old fur coat, and it's important to burn this old fur coat in order to get rid of any influences of the witch. So I and a number of other people -- I don't know who these are -- are trying to burn it and I try to light the coat directly, and it won't burn very well. It flickered for a bit and then would go out. The fur doesn't seem to catch at all So then we set it up on a framework with a pile of leaves underneath. All this time we're in sort of an alley between two brick buildings. So we set fire to these leaves and things piled underneath, and then I get a whole bunch of big photographs, 4 x 6 prints, to throw in the fire to help it burn. These photographs have come from the student newspaper on campus, and are extras from their files. I'm looking thru these photographs as I throw them in and occasionally pulling out one that I don't want to burn. One of the first ones I pulled out had a picture of a very nice girl with no clothes on, so I decide to save that. Then I seem to pull out several that seem to be photographs made of me when I was a young child. I can't recall now what I was doing in these photographs, but I recognized them at the time as photographs taken of me which I hadn't seen in years. Well anyway, I saved some of these photographs, threw others into the fire, trying to make the coat burn, and the coat still wouldn't burn at all to speak of. Then I went off and did something and the place where we were burning the coat was sort of the student newspaper, I think. I noticed someone from the newspaper, a man, had picked up the photographs I had put aside to save and was filing them away in their files. I argued with him about this, that these were my photographs. He said no, they were the paper's, and I argued that they had thrown them out and I wanted to save those and they were mine anyway. He would have none of this argument and continued putting them back in the files, so I went out in anger and told him that the curse would probably fall on them because they interfered with burning the coat. I don't know yet if the coat managed to burn or not. I suspect not. Now my sex seemed to change and I was a young woman. I went up several flights of stairs to my apartment, which I apparently shared with this old woman who was a witch. I was very ambivalent about what I had done. I was glad to get rid of her and yet afraid of having burned her things and gotten rid of her. I don't know how I had gotten ride of her, incidentally, but I knew that she was dead. Yet in some ways I kind of missed her because I liked her, so I went into my apartment and was still very mad at the people at the newspaper and so I practiced some kind of spell to bring them bad luck or something. It was as though I was following in the witch's footsteps. And a lot of time passed, although I didn't experience it. And still as the young woman I was having trouble getting jobs and the like because of my connection with the witch. Finally I thought I would have a job as a servant to some woman who lived in one of the apartments downstairs. I went down and knocked at the door and it turned out she just wanted me to babysit for the afternoon while she went out shopping, but I took it anyway. The woman went out and I went into one of the back bedrooms This incident might have happened before this, but I'll describe it as happening now because I'm not sure. I went into one of the back bedrooms, which was only partially lit, and the old witch kind of materialized in the bed, and I was quite frightened, and she was calling my name, which I forget. It was some girl's name, but I don't recall it. Finally she dematerialized again and was gone. I went up to the front of the apartment to take care of the little children. There was a little boy and a little girl, both of them somewhere between 4 and 5, and I had put the children to bed. They were sleeping side by side in a big double bed, and I was telling them to go to bed, and as I was covering them, they both simultaneously became possessed by the witch. I jumped on top of them to hold them still and there was some tendency on their part to disappear and for the body of the witch to take their place. My sex may have been a little bit indeterminate at this point. There were some definite sexual feelings aroused in me by my kneeling over the body of this witch. I think I was trying to keep the body of the witch from materializing and taking over the bodies of these children. Then there follows some confused events which I don't recall clearly, the outcome of which was that I had died. I was a male again, incidentally. I was starting down a road after having died and there was a voice speaking to me from somewhere, and I asked it which road was the road to hell. It told me and told me that it was the one I would have to go down, and the road said something about experiencing again all these experiences of life. So I started down this road, which incidentally looked like a road I drove down yesterday on my way back from a psychiatric convention, but after going down this road a little ways, the voice told me to turn off onto a side road. I did and there was a stream with a little bridge across it, and there was a swing on the bridge, and a young girl in her teens, swinging in it. The voice told me here was an opportunity to redeem myself for having been involved with this witchcraft in my life, that this young girl was going to swing kind of hard in the swing and her father, who was standing on the other side of the bridge, didn't want her to. The girl actually had some suicidal tendencies, and if I could stop her from committing suicide, it would be a good thing for me. So I walked over to the bridge and the girl's father came up behind her. I sat down on the swing beside her. She couldn't see me or touch me or anything because I was dead, and her father told her a couple of other things and that she shouldn't swing so high. She promised him she wouldn't and then her father went off on some kind of business. Then my voice instructed me to see to it that the girl went somewhere and then learned how to make love and then came back here. So I was wondering how I was going to explain to her since she couldn't hear me, and then I began to wonder whether this was a test in itself because I thought at first that I should do exactly what this voice told me, but then I thought if this girl is feeling kind of suicidal and if she goes off and makes love for the first time and then feels guilty afterwards, and then goes off and commits suicide, which is what I'm supposed  to prevent, maybe I was supposed to think for myself and not give unquestioning obedience to this voice.

         "I'm in a house with Gail - I don't know if it's her house or not. I've been doing something with some others & need to go home - it's not that we've been all together doing whatever it is, but I have been doing whatever I'm supposed to be doing, on my own, involving moving around the house. Gail is working somewhere in another part of the house & I'm taking my leave, basically - I've gone through the kitchen & looked in the refrigerator to see if there's anything to munch on particularly, to take along for the ride. There's nothing - I'm disappointed and I'm going on to get my gear in another room. So I do that, and on the way back take a turn through the kitchen again & lo and behold there's some cookies now, nice looking ones - storebought but that's okay - so I munch on one and, grabbing a few others & holding them in my hand, I go on. I run into some of the other people, including Gail, who is sitting I think at a computer & working. I'm hiding the cookies - I don't want them to see that I've taken them without permission & I've got them down at my side in my hand - and occasionally when I have to move my hand I squish it a little bit & I'm afraid I'm squashing the cookies but that is how it is, I guess. On my way past where Gail is sitting I see that she has some other cookies too, of her own, on a tray - they're very nice looking as a matter of fact, these look homemade, some of them have chocolate on them, I think - and I wish that I'd been around to get some of those. But that's sad, and I go on. The house apparently leads into a hardware store because I am in a hardware store next, and I haven't been outside and walked into it. It's very close; there's stuff everywhere, even overhead, sort of a general-store look to it - there's more than one room, and there's nobody about -I know the store's run by a family, there's a number of them - and I wonder if they're closed, which would be very strange. I pass by the front door and see that there's a hasp on it, and it's moved over but there isn't any padlock and I'm most concerned about that - how in the world could it be that there's nobody here and they're closed but they haven't locked the door? It's most disconcerting, and I decide I'd better call the police. I go a little way beyond the front door and see that I can see in the mirror if there's somebody at the front, and indeed there is. There's a mirror rigged so you can see whoever's just outside the front door. There's a young woman, blond I think - she's got on a sort of business suit - looks like a nice person. She opens the door and comes in - I can see her standing in the entry - I move forward a little bit and make a casual remark - as least it sounded casual to me, about how, \"Oh, I didn't realize that anyone was coming in - I wanted to see if it was possible to get in the front door.\" She looks rather startled and concerned - looks around and leaves. I hadn't realized she couldn't see me - the entry is a very close place too, kind of cave-like, and this mirror's not flat against the wall like I thought it was, I have to look for it. I myself am beyond the wall into the next room and I can see into the entry to that room; there's no door to shut, and the mirror I'm seeing is in a kind of cleft or recess in the wall, which is on the craggy side, and it's placed at just such an angle that you can see what you need to see - for instance, somebody coming in the front door, but they can't see you. They can't see the mirror either. So she's gone, and at this time the proprietor shows up, and his family, and it turns out that what's been going on is they've been preparing for a family celebration of some kind. They've gone off to get things from the back - food and whatnot - and they have left the store open, but they didn't figure they'd be gone any length of time. Now I'm feeling kind of thwarted - here I was going to be a hero - I had been telling them, \"Well, yes, I saved your store from being robbed\" maybe, or something, but I'm no longer needed now. Before I go I figure I will go into this side room and do a kind of meditation ritual which involves spreading a sort of blanket (or maybe it's a robe of some kind) and setting a little altar sort of thing, and I'm starting to do that. But the owner is also setting up something in this room - it might be a barbecue pit or something like that - he and one of his sons maybe or another relative, are bustling around carrying things and setting them up in the middle and he's pretty oblivious to me. I guess that I could be going on doing what I'm doing for all of him, but I'm definitely uncomfortable carrying on with it - I think that I might, I guess, but I realize there's no way I can meditate with this going on. So I pack up my stuff and I'm thinking maybe I'll do it at home - not the best way to do it but I'll do it. Now right after this (or between the house and the hardware store, but I think it's after) I stop by a place where there are people I know (I don't think it's the hardware store family but it might be) and there is a young girl that's a friend of mine - she has bought a puzzle game that she's wanting everybody to do and before I go she wants me to put a piece of the puzzle in - she hands me one and says, \"There ya go - go ahead - you put this one in, this is where we are!\" and she shows me the picture of how it's supposed to look. I figure where it's supposed to go and I put it in and then I grab another one and put it in, and suddenly of course I've got jigsaw-puzzle fever. My piece looked like a corner - like land on a map next to water, but it was definitely a right angle [but?] that was supposed to be where we are - and I can see a piece that looks like a part of New England - like New Jersey or Maine or something like that, maybe New York, and I'm thinking, okay, this is a map of New England. But it's not really and as I keep putting things together bit by bit it turns out that it's not just that but it's the whole United States - how did I miss that? That's really strange. I've got the thing mostly put together, and I realize - and my friend does too - that if I keep on going like this, her family's not going to have any parts to put into it, and it's embarrassing. But at the same time I want to finish it, oh, just got a few more pieces! But the better part of valor is to take it all apart and let the family do it - someone comes in, a man who is familiar but I don't know who he is now, maybe he's an actor or some other personality, don't think somebody I really know, I think he's the dad here, and he makes some joke about taking it all apart because he doesn't know why I put it all together in the first place. So I pull all the pieces apart and put them back in the box. Now, there's also a scene from a time before the house with Gail in it, I think - it seems to be gone - I am in another house with another group of people and there's a big metal shelving unit with things on it that falls over and falls right on a glass-topped coffee table. I can see it start to go and I realize it's going to break the thing to smithereens if it lands there, but there isn't anything that I can do about it while it slowly keels over and goes kablam. There's pieces of glass everywhere and everybody's gonna have to help clean it up and we're gonna have to be careful, of course, not to get cut by the glass.",

         "I had gone in to work for CAS. Instead of just letting me go completely, Bill C reduced my work hours drastically. He would just have me come in a few hours a week or on a project basis. I had gone in when he requested me to. I'm sitting at a very large table, kind of like a conference table. There is stuff piled everywhere. I'm sitting there sifting through things, wondering why I'm even there. Someone comes in and picks up some very large pieces of paper that look like bluelines. Just seeing those makes me feel upset. I start thinking about Bryan N and become intensely more angry. (I woke up feeling so angry and irritable). Bill C came in and sat down in a chair, kind of behind me and to my left, but facing me. He crossed his legs at the knees, and was sitting there with one hand on his knees and smiling at me. I turned halfway around to my left to face him. I asked him why he even has me keep coming back in. His expression didn't change at all. He just sat there smiling at me and didn't answer me. It suddenly occurred to me that I am no longer eligible for unemployment, so there was no reason for me to stay. I told him that I was not coming back anymore. I was dressed in all black. I have on a skirt with something down the front of it that resembled a ruffle. It had a slight slit in the front as well. As I was sitting facing Bill C, I had my legs crossed at the knees and my hand lying at the hem of my skirt right were the slit was. I was at home in bed, and it was dark. I was lying on my left side with my back to the door. I don't think I was fully asleep. I thought someone had come in the bedroom door, but I wasn't sure if I was dreaming or someone really had come in. So I just lay there very still and kept listening and waiting to see if I heard anything else or if anything else happened. It felt like someone was getting into bed behind me. I was very scared and didn't know if I should turn over on my back to see if someone was really there or not. I thought that if I had been dreaming when I turned over to my back, I would see that no one was there and then I would be able to relax. The first time or two that I tried, I couldn't move. The third time, just as I started to move I saw an arm come over me. It pulled back just as I began to move, so I quickly turned back to my left side. After I did this, the arm came back around me and took me into an embrace. I realized that it was Bill C. I seemed to be feeling a lot of different emotions at once. I was feeling anger, compassion, warmth, caring, understanding, and dislike all at once. I put my right hand on his arm as I turned slightly onto my back, just enough so I could turn my head and see him. He had propped himself on his side, resting on his left elbow. So as I turned I found myself facing him directly with our faces just inches apart. I think I was the first one to speak, but I don't know what I said. As I spoke, I moved my right hand and gently placed it on his left cheek. I raised my left hand and placed it lightly behind his head and rested partially on his hair and partially on his bare neck. I don't know who initiated it, but we kissed gently. He began to kiss me more, with more feeling, though I can't say that it was passionate. I realize that he had removed all of his clothes before he climbed into bed. Because I had gone to bed with nothing on, I was now feeling very vulnerable. Just then, I heard someone come in downstairs. There had been someone else down there, who was supposed to be there and who was still awake. It was Jane C who had just come in. She headed directly for the staircase leading to the bedroom. The other person tried to stop her, knowing that Bill C was up there with me. Jane C just dismissed this person and kept walking toward the staircase. The bedroom was an open loft, so Bill C and I could both see her. It was a very large area, and the staircase was along the right wall, and it was an arc shape. Bill C jumped up and I pointed behind the bed where there was room for him to crouch down so Jane C wouldn't see him. At the same time, I jumped up and grabbed my robe and was putting it on as I headed towards the staircase. I had hoped to get to the bottom of the steps before she started up so I could stop her. She was already three quarters of the way up the steps by the time I got to the top of the staircase. I just stopped and waited. Bill C had not fully gotten behind the bed yet. She told him not to bother trying to hide. I started apologizing profusely. I wanted to tell her that I had not invited him there. Before I had a chance to say anything she placed her hands on my face and smiled and said, \"It's okay. It's okay. I don't mind.\" She proceeded to tell me that she is gay. Her and Bill C were staying married for Kara C's sake, but they had agreed to see other people so they could each satisfy their needs for an emotionally or physically intimate romantic relationship. Even so, I don't know that I want to be in relationship with Bill C. I haven't liked him lately and have not wanted anything to do with him. I thought I would be happy to never see him again. I am lying in bed, still with no clothes on, but covered with my flannel sheet. One of their mother's is lying in bed with me, to my left. She is a short woman with short black hair and somewhat Asian in appearance. She is very upset by all of this and talking to me about it, though I don't get the feeling that she is particularly upset with me, or blaming me. I am feeling very awkward, especially because she is in bed with me and I don't have any clothes on. Then Jane C gets into bed also, to my right. The three of us are now lying there discussing this. Jane C makes the mother feel okay about it all and we end up chatting and joking a bit. She turns to her right side and falls asleep. She has both of my bed pillows under her head, with her right arm under them. I don't know why but I feel the need to comfort her so I turn onto my right side and begin to slide my right arm under her head. As I do this I think that maybe I could gently roll her onto her back and could then get one of the pillows for under my own head. As I try to roll her onto her back and reach with my left hand for one of the pillows she begins to wake up. I quickly lower my left hand onto her left arm. She thinks I am making an advance towards her and makes it clear that she is not interested. I wasn't going to tell her that I really just wanted a pillow. I am at a public facility something like a YMCA. I am very upset and angry about everything that has happened, from ending my job with Bill C to everything that happened in the bedroom. I want to find a way to physically work off the negative emotions. Someone I know well, a friend, is the manager of this facility. It almost seems as though it might be Bonnie K. We're talking about what's going on at the facility. There are a lot of people there. She is telling me what the various people are doing. I decide the best way for me to feel better is to work so I ask how I can help. I'm walking around the women's locker room looking at what is available there. There are quite a few individual stalls that appear to be athletic-type soaking tubs. The deep stainless-steel type with some kind of whirlpool equipment attached to the outside. However, it also had something that resembled shower hardware attached to the wall. Because of the way they were built and the things that I saw in each one, I wasn't sure what they were. Two young girls walked by and I heard them talking and giggling about them being both tubs and steam rooms. They were mocking women who use them. There seemed to be quite a few women in the locker room. It was divided by walls into different areas. The showers were in a separate area from these tubs. As I was walking around this area I was thinking how long it had been since I had used a steam room and sauna and how great it would feel. It would also feel great to use a whirlpool or to be able to take a bubble bath in a large, deep bathtub. Bonnie K is working behind a high counter, like you might see at a doctor's office. The public area on the other side is long, but fairly narrow, more like a hallway than a room or reception area. The counter and wall that it runs along has an arc shape.",

         "Interpret this dream: I had gone in to work for CAS. Instead of just letting me go completely, Bill C reduced my work hours drastically. He would just have me come in a few hours a week or on a project basis. I had gone in when he requested me to. I'm sitting at a very large table, kind of like a conference table. There is stuff piled everywhere. I'm sitting there sifting through things, wondering why I'm even there. Someone comes in and picks up some very large pieces of paper that look like bluelines. Just seeing those makes me feel upset. I start thinking about Bryan N and become intensely more angry. (I woke up feeling so angry and irritable). Bill C came in and sat down in a chair, kind of behind me and to my left, but facing me. He crossed his legs at the knees, and was sitting there with one hand on his knees and smiling at me. I turned halfway around to my left to face him. I asked him why he even has me keep coming back in. His expression didn't change at all. He just sat there smiling at me and didn't answer me. It suddenly occurred to me that I am no longer eligible for unemployment, so there was no reason for me to stay. I told him that I was not coming back anymore. I was dressed in all black. I have on a skirt with something down the front of it that resembled a ruffle. It had a slight slit in the front as well. As I was sitting facing Bill C, I had my legs crossed at the knees and my hand lying at the hem of my skirt right were the slit was. I was at home in bed, and it was dark. I was lying on my left side with my back to the door. I don't think I was fully asleep. I thought someone had come in the bedroom door, but I wasn't sure if I was dreaming or someone really had come in. So I just lay there very still and kept listening and waiting to see if I heard anything else or if anything else happened. It felt like someone was getting into bed behind me.

         "I was using the bathroom at ITI. I went to wash my hands and couldn't find the soap dispenser. I was wondering what they did with it. Then the towel dispenser wasn't where it used to be. I found where they had moved it. Another woman was in there and partially blocking the towel dispenser. I reached for a towel but what I pulled out felt more like a wad of hair strands, which made me very uncomfortable. I just threw them in the trash receptacle. It felt like the other woman was watching me. I stepped back to the counter to check my hair and realized I had left my headband in before I left home and was actually wearing two of them. I had one black fabric one, the type that is a circle that you slip around your neck and then pull up over your hair. On top of that I had a red plastic one that you simply slide onto the top of your head where you want it to hold your hair back. My hair was white blonde, very straight. The length was just above chin. I took the red headband off and placed it in my bag. There was a partial wall partition between this counter and another. I stepped to the other side of the wall partition, away from the other woman to finish fixing my hair. I liked the way it looked that day. As I got ready to leave the bathroom I couldn't remember where I had been working that morning. Then I realized that I hadn't been working there at all that morning. They hadn't called me yet to come back in. I had been operating in a trance all morning and had gotten up, got dressed, and came here without even realizing it. I was so embarrassed and I didn't want anyone to know. Fortunately, I could leave the bathroom and get to the door without anyone but the receptionist seeing me. She wouldn't know any different so I just left. I was very upset as I got in my car and left. I got to the circle in the road and it was only one lane instead of the two that it has in waking life. There was a row of people standing in the lane. They were all facing one man at the front of the line, who was facing them and talking. They were having some kind of a meeting. Even though I was in my car, it felt like I was just standing behind the last person in the line. I was contemplating what to do. I wouldn't go the wrong way on the circle and risk being hit head-on by another car, but there really wasn't a way for me to do that anyway from where I was. There was no other place for me to go. I decided to wait and see if they were getting ready to move but the front man just kept talking. I finally moved over to get his attention. He seemed irritated but finally directed the people to move off of the circle so car traffic could continue to use it. As I headed south on Meridian I was still very upset about operating in a trance earlier. I was thinking about all the things I might have done without even realizing it. What if anyone else had seen me? Had I spoken with anyone? It was very upsetting. When I approached the ramp to the highway I realized that the city had been doing some major construction and was turning this into one of those highway rest areas that you see on overpasses in Chicago. Between thinking about that and still being upset about what happened earlier I missed my ramp and didn't realize it until I had gone another two or more miles. I was got very upset with myself now for my lack of focus on my driving and where I was going. I tried to decide the best way for me to go now to get back home. It was raining and there was lots of traffic, which was making me feel even more agitated. I decided I would go to Westfield Blvd and take that home but then passed it without realizing it. I was trying to figure out what to do next and found myself downtown. I'm driving through this one lane street that feels more like a walking path. I remember someone else driving me through here so I know that it really is intended for cars. It weaves around a number of historical buildings that are very old and beautiful in their architectural detail. I finally decided to just park and take a walk. I was thinking about how nice it would be to be able to shop at some different stores to find clothing a little higher quality and with a little more style than what I normally buy. I decide to just walk through some of the stores and see what types of things are available and at what price. I stopped to look at something displayed in a window. Two men cross behind me and enter a dry cleaner. Within minutes they come out and go on their way. As they are walking away from me I recognize the one man as someone I had met with for an informational interview. I was glad that he hadn't seen me. The other man I recognized but I couldn't remember where I had met or seen him before. I continued to walk and find myself walking through a building close to the Humanities Council office. I remembered having lunch there with the president of the Humanities Council. It was the start of lunch hour and the place was beginning to get busy with working people on their lunch break. I had walked through the building to get to the other side of the block instead of walking all the way around in the rain. As I stepped outside again I opened my umbrella and began to stroll down the street. I wasn't in a hurry and wasn't sure where I even wanted to go. I wasn't familiar with the stores downtown, what stores were there or where they were or anything. I stopped momentarily on a corner. There was an older couple standing there under a navy blue umbrella. The edges of the umbrella were made very different than anything I had ever seen before in that the ends folded in creating little pockets on the underside edges of the umbrella. I realized that this kept the water from dripping on you so much and thought that was a very nice feature for an umbrella. She said something to me about enjoying the rain and I agreed with her and commented that not too many people feel that way about rain. She smiled. The three of us began chatting. While we were chatting the state governor walked up to us with another man. The governor knew this couple I was talking with and stopped to say hello to them. He looked at me so I extended my hand and introduced myself. He half-smiled, shook my hand and then continued talking with the couple. Now other people had gathered and joined the conversation and I found myself on the outside of the gathering with no one even seeing me there. I tried briefly to get the attention of the woman I had been talking to so I could mind my manners and tell her it was nice chatting with her but I couldn't so I just walked away. As I walked I came upon another older woman. She said something to me about shopping. I asked her if she would mind telling me where she shops for her clothes as I really liked her style. She thanked me and told the names of two stores that she shops at mostly. I had not heard of either so I asked her where they were and she pointed them out to me. I walked into the first one and felt very disoriented. I couldn't tell if I was in a mall or in a single store. There seemed to be construction going on. I saw some women clothing through an opening so I went in there. There weren't a lot of things and there were too many women shopping around my size for me to be able to look at anything. I heard a group of friends talking. One of them looked and sounded so much like Dorothea D that I looked closely several times to be sure it wasn't her. I went to another area with women clothing. The third area I went in to I finally decided to at least try something on, so I selected two items. A sales clerk saw me and headed towards me. She wasn't sure which dressing room to send me to but finally decided on one and pointed it out to me. Just as I got to the entrance a man came out. This made me wonder if I was in the right place but there was nothing else around so I decided it had to me. Maybe this was just a main entrance and behind the door I would find separate entrances for men and for women. That wasn't the case but I realized it was only women in there. The whole thing was made out of heavy cardboard. There was a swinging door at the main entrance that didn't fit right and was hard to push open. Each of the single dressing booths were barely deep enough for a person to stand inside. I couldn't stand inside and change clothes so I left the door partially open. I tried to change in a way that I wouldn't feel too exposed. The first thing I tried on was a pair of black dress pants that was part of a suit. They were way too tight on the thighs and I couldn't even get them all the way on my thighs. I was very discouraged but realized that sized fit differently at different stores. I know this from experience so now I at least have a better idea of what size I will need to buy if I shop at this store. I decided not to even try the other thing on.",

I walked into the first one and felt very disoriented. I couldn't tell if I was in a mall or in a single store. There seemed to be construction going on. I saw some women clothing through an opening so I went in there. There weren't a lot of things and there were too many women shopping around my size for me to be able to look at anything. I heard a group of friends talking. One of them looked and sounded so much like Dorothea D that I looked closely several times to be sure it wasn't her. I went to another area with women clothing. The third area I went in to I finally decided to at least try something on, so I selected two items. A sales clerk saw me and headed towards me. She wasn't sure which dressing room to send me to but finally decided on one and pointed it out to me. Just as I got to the entrance a man came out. This made me wonder if I was in the right place but there was nothing else around so I decided it had to me. Maybe this was just a main entrance and behind the door I would find separate entrances for men and for women. That wasn't the case but I realized it was only women in there. The whole thing was made out of heavy cardboard. There was a swinging door at the main entrance that didn't fit right and was hard to push open. Each of the single dressing booths were barely deep enough for a person to stand inside. I couldn't stand inside and change clothes so I left the door partially open. I tried to change in a way that I wouldn't feel too exposed. The first thing I tried on was a pair of black dress pants that was part of a suit. They were way too tight on the thighs and I couldn't even get them all the way on my thighs. I was very discouraged but realized that sized fit differently at different stores. I know this from experience so now I at least have a better idea of what size I will need to buy if I shop at this store. I decided not to even try the other thing on.\nSymbols: - Comb: To dream that you are combing your hair suggests your need to organize and sort your thoughts.

         "Dream took place in the morning between the hours of 8 and 9 a.m. I was waiting for a bus at a bus stop in a big city like Philadelphia. It was night and the weather was summer-like. My best friend Bill was waiting with me, though he wasn't going with me. My destination was a market place. I believe it was referred to as the egg market. My friend Bill insisted that I take along several cardboard boxes in order to carry my purchases. Several buses had come and turned the corner one block from where I and several others had been waiting. I decided to go down to the next block to catch the bus, seeing that obviously they came to that point with greater frequency than to the point where I was waiting. Bill said or implied that I shouldn't do so. While he was saying this a bus came along, and it was marked Hudson Street, and around the marking Hudson Street there was a kind of green glow as if there was a green light behind this marker. Meanwhile a girl, I believe it was a Puerto Rican woman, though her skin was not dark, it was tannish, had come to the bus stop and had gotten out of a car. It was a white convertible Cadillac. Somehow her intention of going to the egg market had become known to me. There was a large crowd of younger girls clamoring about her as though she were a movie star, but I felt more as though she was a clever and shrewd opportunist, possibly an agent Provocateur. We were on the bus, and as we got underway, I slowly noticed that as the bus turned a corner about 3 blocks from our starting point, that the crowd of girls was chasing the bus, waving and yelling their maudlin goodbyes. The Puerto Rican woman sat in the very back of the bus and I saw these girls out of the back window of the bus. At the point where I saw them clearly, many of them had fall coats on and were open at the front. They were kind of slapping open. In the background I saw what appeared to be Independence Mall, that is Independence Hall with the mall in front of it. At this point it was daylight and there was what appeared to be snow on the ground. The bus in the course of its trip up to this point had taken a somewhat devious route. It had gone over many curb stones and sidewalks, bumping the bus, and yet it was staying predominantly on the road. The girls that were following had been following, continued to follow the bus which was going very slow.  The next scene took place in a restaurant, a restaurant much like the one Gilda and I had had a meal in Key West. It had a lot of stools and it had a counter. There were no tables. At this restaurant I believe I had a meal and got a bill and paid it. This was the same restaurant in which there was a waitress, this was taking place in real life now, who had given me some sidelong stares, rather intense stares two or three times That's all there was to that scene.  The next scene took place in Europe. I was in a shop somewhere in Europe with an American man and the Puerto Rican woman. A woman sales person approached me, asked me something in a foreign language. I believe the language was German. I had been momentarily looking at a chess set and the saleswoman picked the chess set up and started to explain it to me in German or possibly Austrian, how the game was played. I thought to myself how strange this all sounded and also that I knew how to play the game, how to play chess. I chuckled to myself at the thought of how this all sounded. Even though this chess set was shaped like a symbol of a cross, like the Red Cross, it was made out of fine rattan and covered with cellophane. The sales lady in the course of her explanation used the English word \"please,\" and she used it in the sense of an explanation, not as it would be normally used by an English-speaking person. All the while I had been in the back of my mind puzzled over the purposes of the American man who was, it appeared to me, to be a CIA-type of agent of character in regard to his profession. I felt that in some way I was there serving as his protector or in some way looking out for him, and the Puerto Rican woman who was very, very attractive in a Spanish way, was, I believe, a Communist agent who was luring this man into a trap, though it was being done very casually and in an off-handed manner and nobody was getting especially intense about it. Meanwhile, the saleswoman said to me, \"Roger,\" and I looked at her somewhat amazed, though I concealed my amazement. She then said my name again and produced a small, white note pad on which she had written my full name and some words in her native tongue. I then asked her how she knew my name since I hadn't told her, and she said she had gotten it from the bill in the restaurant. I was fully aware that I hadn't signed the bill. I had no idea how she had gotten it. I looked around suspiciously at this point, and felt that the time had come for me to get out with the CIA agent (or possibly some agent for another secret government organization). At this point the saleswoman kind of faded from the scene and I was somehow too late to protect the agent. I seemed to have found myself opening a door that led to the cellar. I felt some sort of a coercion to do this. That is, I felt coerced to do this. As I closed it there appeared a man on the other side who intended to lock me in, and I quickly, gong on to the first step of the cellar stairway, felt in my pocket a folded piece of paper. I stuck it in the door catch in such a way that it prevented the door from locking. I marveled at my own cleverness. However, it didn't fit too well, that is the paper didn't fit because there were several coins wrapped up in it. I believe they were quarters. However, after fooling with it for a moment or two, it finally did the job which I had intended. I proceeded downstairs and entered a room in which there was the American agent, the Puerto Rican woman and two or three henchmen, I guess, and hazily, somehow -- their leader. This group that was in conspiracy apparently was the two or three henchmen and this hazily conceived leader and the Puerto Rican woman. I announced my intention to escape and went over to the CIA type agent and told him about my intentions and why and tried to convince him that he should come with me. I told him how we were being trapped, although I could not convince him. We argued at some length and he just completely resisted believing me, even though someone said to me, \"You'll never get across the border.\" By the border I felt as though there was a border like that between East and West Berlin before the wall. At this point someone had been drinking a cup of hot liquid and I requested a drink of water. A very big guy about my age, dressed as a merchant seaman, handed me a cup of hot water, and I told him no, I wanted cold water. He had gotten the hot water from some hot water boiler-like apparatus. For some reason I made him the butt of a sarcastic humorous remark for having done what appeared to be such a stupid thing. Everybody seemed to laugh with me at him. This guy was exactly like in size the subject I had been running the previous night who had also been drinking a cup of coffee. Some other interplay occurred with the persons present. I believe I was roundly discouraged by them from attempting to get successfully away, but I left and as I was coming up the stairs, and just as I was opening the door, I awoke.  The overall feelings of this dream was that I was engaged in a battle of wits in which nobody ever really fully completely won or lost, at least in the immediate time, the immediate situation. I felt a rather optimistic sense of ultimate victory would be the outcome. The only color in the dream was the merchant seaman who had a dark blue boat on, blue pants, a white shirt, and the color previously mentioned on the bus sign. There was some color in the park at Independence Mall. It now seems that the Puerto Rican woman was more correctly a Cuban.",

         "I went to see Alice S to ask her a couple of questions. I can't get a sense of the building I was in. Normally I would be either in the grade school, church offices, or in Shalom House. This was more like a very large, 3-4 story school or. It reminds me of Goodman Hall at SMW. I went into Alice S's office. It was very tiny and uncomfortable to me because it was so small and crowded. It had her desk and some shelves and filing cabinets, two sitting chairs with a table between them and another very small desk also. Alice S was in there. I had asked her something and she was printing a copy or getting a paper for me or for someone else. I'm not sure. The gentleman that works in her office at that very small desk was working at his laptop computer. His name was Scott. He closed it up and left. For some reason I had the sense that he wasn't going to be working there anymore. I asked Alice S what happened to Scott. She said, shh, like we shouldn't talk about it. I sat down in one of the chairs while I was waiting for her. She sat down at her desk and another man came in and started talking to her. He completely ignored me or didn't even see me there. He was standing right in front of me with his back to me and started asking her something. Then he left and a woman came in and actually closed the door behind her. She said, hi boss. Can I have ten minutes of your time? This was an older woman. She looked at me but completely ignored me and didn't say a word to me. Finally Alice S looked at me apologetically and said, would you mind? I said, why don't you give me one of your cards and I'll email you. My tone of voice showed my frustration. I was searching around her desk to pick up a card but I couldn't find one. She said, no, why don't you call me because I wouldn't want this to get lost among a bunch of emails. I said, fine again with the tone of voice. I was very perturbed that I had been there and these other people came in and ignored me and I was the one that kept getting put off. I went ahead and left. I was trying to find my way out of this building. There was also a young boy who seemed to be trying to find his way out as well. I don't know what happened to him as the dream progressed. I finally thought, if I go to the basement I will know my way from there. I went to the basement and then I started going up these escalators. They were not normal escalators but only 1/3 or _ as many steps as a normal one and they seemed to move a bit differently as well. These made me even more uncomfortable than the ones in waking life do. It was like you had to move especially quickly and carefully at the top to get off. I finally got up to this one floor and for some reason I got a wheelchair and was pushing it. I had to get through this one area and had these lines of people like you might see at a bank if there were many tellers and each had their own line. In every line there was at least one person sitting in a wheelchair and I had to get across the front of these people. Most of the people in the wheelchairs were being very nice about it. They had to back up a bit to make room for me to get through with this empty wheelchair. I kind of brushed up against a couple of them and apologized. I finally got through. For some reason it seems that I took the empty wheelchair just so I could get through. Someone asked me to take this woman in a hospital bed to her new room. She was being transferred to another room. I must have been at SVH. I realized later that I was. They didn't tell me what floor this woman needed to go to and she didn't know either. I stopped at this one place that was kind of like a snack bar window. I asked if they could make a call to find out where she was supposed to be. The manager was being very uncooperative. One of the male employees asked the manager if it was okay to offer the patient some free ice cream. He said that was fine and asked her if she would like some. She said yes so the employee gave her some vanilla soft serve ice cream in a cardboard bowl. I sat her up in her bed and she was eating her ice cream. While we were sitting there these younger adults came up. I thought I recognized the one woman but I didn't say anything. They were relatives of this woman in bed. They were surprised to see her and they chatted for a little while. Somewhere around this point she told me that she was fine and was actually there to do volunteer work. I don't know why she was in this hospital bed. I said, well, I'll tell you what though. Let's have you stay in the bed that way we will be able to get through these different floors without people questioning us. It will be easier for us to go through the various places in the hospital to find out where you are supposed to be. She agreed to that. I then said, let's start at the third floor because that makes most sense to me as far as a place to start. After she finished her ice cream and finished talking to her relatives I had her lay back down and I took her up to the 3rd floor. I went through a couple of departments and a couple of them said that this patient wasn't theirs. we went into this one area like a small pharmacy. I was having trouble maneuvering this bed around in there because the aisles were so narrow and short. While we were in there a doctor came running in yelling tube, tube, tube. He ran in a pulled a tube in a plastic wrapper off the shelf, ripped it open and just dropped the wrapper, and ran back out and down the hall. There were maybe 4 or 5 more doctors who came running down the hall towards us. They had blood all over them and some medical things in their hands. I thought they were running in to us. But I guess they decided they didn't need to. They calmed down and ran around and said yes he was breathing okay and the tube was clear. They went back and she had a concerned look on her face. I said don't worry, it will be okay. They won't have you volunteering any place that is really uncomfortable for you. The doctors that had blood all over them had splatter blood all over her face. I took a towel and gently wiped it off, I recall the most being on her forehead. We went on working our way to some departments trying to find where she was supposed to be. I came across a large male black nurse. I asked him if he could tell me where the admissions office is for this area. He told me where to go. I headed over there. I saw a nurse sitting by a desk. There was a very small newborn. maybe a preemie. next to her. I think it was in an incubator. She was on the phone. When she got off the phone I explained why we were there and that this woman was really fine. I had kept her on the bed so we could get through the various departments to find out where she was supposed to be. She was supposed to be volunteering. The nurse was very nice. She was a younger black female nurse. While we were waiting for her to get off the phone I was wondering if this was the new pediatric unit that SVH has been building, or if it was the new pediatric sleep center. At that point the nurse said the woman could get out of bed and she would take care of it from there. I could just take the bed out. I headed out with the empty bed and came across this male nurse again. He said he was on his way to put back another empty bed so I could just follow him. I jokingly said, oh, you were supposed to give me a ride now. He just laughed. He went really fast and I couldn't keep up with him so I was practically running to keep up with him. I guess staff thought I was playing with the empty bed or something because they were all looking at me and grinning. I saw Doctor C at the end of the hall so I aimed it at him like I was going to run into him. When I got up to him I stopped to say hello. His hair was completely gray. He spoke very briefly, but friendly. Just not what I expected after not seeing him for a year. I thought he would seem happier to see me. I just chalked it up to him being either very busy or in one of his moods. Either way this is how he would have acted so I didn't take it personally.",

I was searching around her desk to pick up a card but I couldn't find one. She said, no, why don't you call me because I wouldn't want this to get lost among a bunch of emails. I said, fine again with the tone of voice. I was very perturbed that I had been there and these other people came in and ignored me and I was the one that kept getting put off. I went ahead and left. I was trying to find my way out of this building. There was also a young boy who seemed to be trying to find his way out as well. I don't know what happened to him as the dream progressed. I finally thought, if I go to the basement I will know my way from there. I went to the basement and then I started going up these escalators. They were not normal escalators but only 1/3 or _ as many steps as a normal one and they seemed to move a bit differently as well. These made me even more uncomfortable than the ones in waking life do. It was like you had to move especially quickly and carefully at the top to get off. I finally got up to this one floor and for some reason I got a wheelchair and was pushing it. I had to get through this one area and had these lines of people like you might see at a bank if there were many tellers and each had their own line. In every line there was at least one person sitting in a wheelchair and I had to get across the front of these people. Most of the people in the wheelchairs were being very nice about it. They had to back up a bit to make room for me to get through with this empty wheelchair. I kind of brushed up against a couple of them and apologized. I finally got through. For some reason it seems that I took the empty wheelchair just so I could get through. Someone asked me to take this woman in a hospital bed to her new room. She was being transferred to another room. I must have been at SVH. I realized later that I was. They didn't tell me what floor this woman needed to go to and she didn't know either. I stopped at this one place that was kind of like a snack bar window. I asked if they could make a call to find out where she was supposed to be. The manager was being very uncooperative. One of the male employees asked the manager if it was okay to offer the patient some free ice cream. He said that was fine and asked her if she would like some. She said yes so the employee gave her some vanilla soft serve ice cream in a cardboard bowl. I sat her up in her bed and she was eating her ice cream. While we were sitting there these younger adults came up. I thought I recognized the one woman but I didn't say anything. They were relatives of this woman in bed. They were surprised to see her and they chatted for a little while. Somewhere around this point she told me that she was fine and was actually there to do volunteer work. I don't know why she was in this hospital bed. I said, well, I'll tell you what though. Let's have you stay in the bed that way we will be able to get through these different floors without people questioning us. It will be easier for us to go through the various places in the hospital to find out where you are supposed to be. She agreed to that. I then said, let's start at the third floor because that makes most sense to me as far as a place to start. After she finished her ice cream and finished talking to her relatives I had her lay back down and I took her up to the 3rd floor. I went through a couple of departments and a couple of them said that this patient wasn't theirs. we went into this one area like a small pharmacy. I was having trouble maneuvering this bed around in there because the aisles were so narrow and short. While we were in there a doctor came running in yelling tube, tube, tube. He ran in a pulled a tube in a plastic wrapper off the shelf, ripped it open and just dropped the wrapper, and ran back out and down the hall. There were maybe 4 or 5 more doctors who came running down the hall towards us. They had blood all over them and some medical things in their hands. I thought they were running in to us. But I guess they decided they didn't need to. They calmed down and ran around and said yes he was breathing okay and the tube was clear. They went back and she had a concerned look on her face. I said don't worry, it will be okay. They won't have you volunteering any place that is really uncomfortable for you. The doctors that had blood all over them had splatter blood all over her face. I took a towel and gently wiped it off, I recall the most being on her forehead. We went on working our way to some departments trying to find where she was supposed to be. I came across a large male black nurse. I asked him if he could tell me where the admissions office is for this area. He told me where to go. I headed over there. I saw a nurse sitting by a desk. There was a very small newborn. maybe a preemie. next to her. I think it was in an incubator. She was on the phone. When she got off the phone I explained why we were there and that this woman was really fine. I had kept her on the bed so we could get through the various departments to find out where she was supposed to be. She was supposed to be volunteering. The nurse was very nice. She was a younger black female nurse. While we were waiting for her to get off the phone I was wondering if this was the new pediatric unit that SVH has been building, or if it was the new pediatric sleep center. At that point the nurse said the woman could get out of bed and she would take care of it from there. I could just take the bed out. I headed out with the empty bed and came across this male nurse again. He said he was on his way to put back another empty bed so I could just follow him. I jokingly said, oh, you were supposed to give me a ride now. He just laughed. He went really fast and I couldn't keep up with him so I was practically running to keep up with him. I guess staff thought I was playing with the empty bed or something because they were all looking at me and grinning. I saw Doctor C at the end of the hall so I aimed it at him like I was going to run into him. When I got up to him I stopped to say hello. His hair was completely gray. He spoke very briefly, but friendly. Just not what I expected after not seeing him for a year. I thought he would seem happier to see me. I just chalked it up to him being either very busy or in one of his moods. Either way this is how he would have acted so I didn't take it personally.\nSymbols: - Cabinet: To dream that someone rearranged your cabinets suggests that somebody is overstepping your boundaries.\n - Desk: To dream that your desk is cluttered indicates that you need to prioritize and reorganize aspects of your life.

         "I was getting ready to leave for classes to teach the nursing students. A lunch had been made up and also the material I was going to need for class that day was deposited in this container, which was sort of like a combination brief case and lunch container. I got onto the bus and it seemed as if for some reason I was wearing a red straw hat. There were a few other people on the bus. Shortly after starting out, the bus was going rather slow and we passed up this one girl from nursing class that I was supposed to see this afternoon. The bus passed very close by her and I waved to her, and although she looked in the bus and looked at me, she ignored me as if she did not recognize me. I thought this was possible because I did have on this red straw hat, but I thought she still should have been able to recognize my face. That hat was something like a farmer's hat, not a dress hat. I was almost thinking about getting off the bus and walking to the classes because it seemed very lazy to ride what was apparently a rather short distance, but then I thought, \"Well, it'll be worth it after all because I'll get there so much earlier and I can then get ready for class.\" I (flatuated) in the dream and in order to put as much distance between myself and the two girls who were sitting in a seat in front of me, I laid on the floor and held on to the bottom of the seat, but it seemed as if by doing so I was being dragged along the pavement itself. The bus was not moving too fast and it was not too uncomfortable, but one of the girls turned and looked over her shoulder and commented to the other about the unusualness of what I was doing. I felt it very unusual myself in that it was slightly uncomfortable being dragged along that way. I thought I was getting my clothes slightly dirty, but I felt this was still more preferable to sitting that close to the girls if I was going to continue to flatuate. Then one of the girls seemed to like this idea and she was starting to lay down on the floor of the bus herself and was motioning for her friend to join her, but instead of lying stretched out on their stomachs, they turned around and curled up facing towards me. Just about this time the bus pulled into the station at the school, and I started to get out. There were some Coca Cola stands nearby and it seemed as if students were buying cokes now to put away for their lunch time. This reminded me about food and I dashed back toward the bus to pick up my combination lunch container and briefcase that had been left behind. As I walked past the Coca Cola machines again, I was annoyed that I only had twenty cents with me. I thought that I really should take more money with me as 2 cents wasn't really enough to take care of anything unexpected that might come up during the day. Then I was unsure of where my class was going to be held. It seemed as if it were supposed to be in room 2 which is down in the corner on the bottom floor, but I for some reason thought it wasn't going to be held there that day. As I started in the building, I noticed one male student who had two different shoes on. One was a blue sneaker and the other one was a white one. They were both somewhat old and worn out, but I thought that he must have salvaged the best remaining member of each of the two pairs. Then as I started to walk up the stairs to the second floor, it seemed as if I took off my old shoes and let the water splash out of them onto the stairs. I don't know how they got so much water in them, but when I turned them upside down quite a bit of water did come out. In some ways there seemed to be some resemblance between this building and the elementary school that I had attended. At some point I'm not sure exactly where, but it seems in and around here, Calvin was saying something to somebody about their being castrated, and when he said it, the person just kind of smiled and seemed to take it as some sort of compliment because the impression that he gave was that he certainly did not understand the meaning of the term. I looked at my watch and it was now 8:30, and I was beginning to worry a little bit because now was the time that class was supposed to start and I still hadn't located the classroom. And it seems as if I certainly should have known where this classroom was. This was 8:30 in the morning. As I got down to the end of the 2nd floor, I was going to start through and go back down to the 1st floor again and check on the corner room I thought it was, but I was delayed in passing thru because there were several people talking on the telephones and I couldn't pass by them. There were two people at one end of the table talking on telephones, and one person at the opposite end. The cords were stretched out so far that you couldn't pass by them unless you wanted to either climb under or over them. Finally one of he people hung up and I started to go thru the gap that now existed near where he was sitting. After I did so there seemed to be large numbers of piles of paper carefully stacked around by the top of the stairs. There seemed to be about 7 or 8 little papers in each pile, and as I stepped toward the top of the stairs, I tried to be very careful not to disturb their position. Then somehow the scene shifted and I was now in a cafeteria line. As I was starting thru the line, I was beginning to move along and a man probably about 40 years old was behind me and he said something to the four or five women who were standing behind the counter, \"I'm castrated. I know so by ESP.\" The women did not seem to catch on to what he was saying, and so he said it over again, \"You see, I've been castrated, I know by ESP.\" The women made some reactions to this, and I thought to myself that this was a very odd thing to say in public with no more provocation than to just spontaneously blurt this out. Then the first woman that  encountered as I walked thru the line said, \"Tell me that you want coffee.\" I said, \"All right, I want coffee.\" Then I got a small steak and a I think it was some peas and carrots, and as I got down to the end of the line, I was getting worried because I thought I only had $2 with me. The cashier at the end said it was $2 even and I took out my wallet and found a $5 bill and about three ones and thought that Doris must have placed some extra money in my wallet, and I was pleased that she had done this. I took out the$5 bill and gave it to the cashier, and she gave me the receipt and two dollar bills in change, which seemed to be the right amount in the dream, although she had clearly said a total of $2. Then there were two dimes lying on the counter by her, and I wasn't sure whether they were mine or not, but I reached up for them and as I did so, some other guy reached for them at the same time so that we both quickly retracted our hands and neither one of us took them. The arrangement in this cafeteria appeared to be that women carried the tray over to your table and the woman carrying mine had already left and I could see her down at the far end of the cafeteria to lead me to a table so I assume that she had left my tray down there. I was somewhat annoyed with myself for being so extravagant and felt that this was too much to pay for a meal, and I could have done it much cheaper someplace else or brought a lunch. Estimated time of the dream would have about 10 minutes.  Back during the dream as I was starting down the stairway past the stacked piles of paper, I reached the bottom of the stairs and some newspaper reporter seemed to recognize me as a psychologist and yelled down, \"Is it true that some kinds of Negroes and Yogis are able to live without food?\" and I shouted back up that no, I didn't know of any instances where people were able to get along without any food. The newspaper man seemed to be with a crowd of other reporters and he was saying something like \"No, I meant is it true that they don't like food?\" and I said yes, of course, people would differ in their reaction to food, that some people made a great deal of it, and for others it was sort of an unpleasant chore or necessity that one's attitude toward food was learned.",

         "I was in my apartment with Mother and some other members of my family that I cannot identify. It was not my waking life apartment. Something had happened that I realized this was a perfect opportunity to make some major furnishing changes in my apartment. I was going to switch the living room with the dining room for one thing. Currently in the dream home, the front door led directly into the dining room. Matthew had already hung curtains so I realized they were going to need to be switched as well. Matthew had arrived home from a visit with his Dad and the apartment was filled to capacity, little floor space left, with old furniture. I found out that Grandma and Grandpa Ho had intended to get rid of all this stuff and Matthew thought I might want some of it because of my interest in antiques and old furniture. So they sent it all with him, with the instructions for me to do whatever with the things I didn't want. There was a lot I didn't want and obviously didn't have room for all of it either. I still wanted to make the switch of the two rooms but now could not even find my original furnishings. At this point there were many other people there, most that I didn't know, and some were Harris family members. I believe BJ and Bev might have been there also. Everyone pitched in and began helping me to clear the place out by eliminating the items I didn't want. Now the apartment had a basement garage so we were taking these things through the stairwell into that space. Bob F was one of the men down there taking things from the people working upstairs. At some point I realized that a lot of the people who were helping were from a not-for-profit group and I was going to donate all of the things I didn't want to them. It almost felt as if things were multiplying because I kept finding more and more stuff that I hadn't realized was there before. There were several old sofas and big easy chairs. There were quite a few huge wood pieces, such as wall units, or bookshelf kind of things. Many of these were hideous looking in my opinion. They were very large, heavy and difficult to move. We were alternating our positions and jobs in clearing the place out. Some people wanted turns being at the top of the stairs. I mostly stood between the various rooms and the top of the stairs and kept pushing things toward the person at the top of the stairs. I would occasionally put things into the stair well myself. Sometimes just sitting things on the first landing and sometimes handing things down to men in the basement/garage. The stairwell had a few steps to the first landing, then turned left and went the rest of the way down. I had taken something with two legs that I thought was very light and not dangerous and just kind of pushed it down. I realized after I let go that one of the legs hit someone in the head. Instead of saying anything I walked away. As I did so I knew I should go back and acknowledge what I did and apologize but I was too embarrassed and for some reason afraid to. Then I heard people talking loudly and criticizing what had happened. The man was bleeding but I don't know how badly. Someone thought he might need stitches but most thought that person was overreacting. I never did go and admit what I had done. This was taking much longer than people had thought it would. Many of us were beginning to get hungry. I went and asked Daddy if I should order dinner to be delivered. I don't remember him answering me then but I didn't do it. At the time I thought I didn't need his permission to do that if I'm going to pay for it myself. Maybe I thought if I asked him he would offer to pay. In waking life I know he would. For whatever reason we didn't order dinner and we kept working. The Harris family members that were there had been there for another reason and had not expected to stay so long. Even when they decided to stay and help with this new situation they didn't realize it would take so long. I don't think any of us did. They were particularly hungry. I kept thinking about how Darren and Matthew got all of this stuff here and how I could have been unaware of them bringing all of this stuff into the apartment when it had to have taken them a good deal of time. BJ and Bev kept identifying items that they thought I would want to keep. One of them found a beautiful bedroom suit. It was white with a pastel flower design/fabric on parts of it. I said that I absolutely wanted to keep that. In waking life I have wanted a new bedroom suit for almost 20 years, but can never seem to afford it. They and we found quite a few really great furniture items, artwork, two really great desks. one that I would keep in the kitchen and one for my office, other decorative items. Some of the artwork seemed very contemporary and colorful. In fact, there was an artist there painting a piece similar to several that were already there. I felt bad that he saw me deciding to give them away. I kind of liked them but not enough to keep them in light of everything I had there. At some point the scene shifted and we were still in the same apartment but it now seemed as though we were clearing out the remnants of someone who used to live there for us to move in. There were things hanging on the walls that needed to be removed. Some things I would decide to keep and either not remove or rehang after thinking about it. In the kitchen there were cabinets full of white/see-through plastic containers and I gave away the containers and everything. There were also quite a few small wooden cabinets for lack of a better word, that had lots of little compartments and such. They were each made to house certain types of items. I had removed one from the wall, examined it carefully, and then replaced it deciding to keep it. I then decided to keep all of the similar ones. There were also two or more refrigerators. They had containers in them but no food. I gave away all but one of them, containers and all. The one I kept seemed to fit nicely into a kitchen cove. It was smaller than a conventional home refrigerator and it was brown. As we continued to clear things out I decided to put all of the artwork in one place together and I would not go through it until after I had the furniture I wanted and placed where I wanted it. Then I could better decide which artwork I wanted to keep and had the space to hang. There was a lot of artwork and I really liked most of it. We continued to try to find the living room and dining room pieces that I wanted to keep and get them placed where I wanted them.

         "Interpret this dream: I was in my apartment with Mother and some other members of my family that I cannot identify. It was not my waking life apartment. Something had happened that I realized this was a perfect opportunity to make some major furnishing changes in my apartment. I was going to switch the living room with the dining room for one thing. Currently in the dream home, the front door led directly into the dining room. Matthew had already hung curtains so I realized they were going to need to be switched as well. Matthew had arrived home from a visit with his Dad and the apartment was filled to capacity, little floor space left, with old furniture. I found out that Grandma and Grandpa Ho had intended to get rid of all this stuff and Matthew thought I might want some of it because of my interest in antiques and old furniture. So they sent it all with him, with the instructions for me to do whatever with the things I didn't want. There was a lot I didn't want and obviously didn't have room for all of it either. I still wanted to make the switch of the two rooms but now could not even find my original furnishings. At this point there were many other people there, most that I didn't know, and some were Harris family members. I believe BJ and Bev might have been there also. Everyone pitched in and began helping me to clear the place out by eliminating the items I didn't want. Now the apartment had a basement garage so we were taking these things through the stairwell into that space. Bob F was one of the men down there taking things from the people working upstairs. At some point I realized that a lot of the people who were helping were from a not-for-profit group and I was going to donate all of the things I didn't want to them. It almost felt as if things were multiplying because I kept finding more and more stuff that I hadn't realized was there before. There were several old sofas and big easy chairs. There were quite a few huge wood pieces, such as wall units, or bookshelf kind of things. Many of these were hideous looking in my opinion. They were very large, heavy and difficult to move. We were alternating our positions and jobs in clearing the place out. Some people wanted turns being at the top of the stairs. I mostly stood between the various rooms and the top of the stairs and kept pushing things toward the person at the top of the stairs. I would occasionally put things into the stair well myself. Sometimes just sitting things on the first landing and sometimes handing things down to men in the basement/garage. The stairwell had a few steps to the first landing, then turned left and went the rest of the way down. I had taken something with two legs that I thought was very light and not dangerous and just kind of pushed it down. I realized after I let go that one of the legs hit someone in the head. Instead of saying anything I walked away. As I did so I knew I should go back and acknowledge what I did and apologize but I was too embarrassed and for some reason afraid to. Then I heard people talking loudly and criticizing what had happened. The man was bleeding but I don't know how badly. Someone thought he might need stitches but most thought that person was overreacting. I never did go and admit what I had done. This was taking much longer than people had thought it would. Many of us were beginning to get hungry. I went and asked Daddy if I should order dinner to be delivered. I don't remember him answering me then but I didn't do it. At the time I thought I didn't need his permission to do that if I'm going to pay for it myself. Maybe I thought if I asked him he would offer to pay. In waking life I know he would. For whatever reason we didn't order dinner and we kept working. The Harris family members that were there had been there for another reason and had not expected to stay so long. Even when they decided to stay and help with this new situation they didn't realize it would take so long. I don't think any of us did. They were particularly hungry. I kept thinking about how Darren and Matthew got all of this stuff here and how I could have been unaware of them bringing all of this stuff into the apartment when it had to have taken them a good deal of time. BJ and Bev kept identifying items that they thought I would want to keep. One of them found a beautiful bedroom suit. It was white with a pastel flower design/fabric on parts of it. I said that I absolutely wanted to keep that. In waking life I have wanted a new bedroom suit for almost 20 years, but can never seem to afford it. They and we found quite a few really great furniture items, artwork, two really great desks. one that I would keep in the kitchen and one for my office, other decorative items. Some of the artwork seemed very contemporary and colorful. In fact, there was an artist there painting a piece similar to several that were already there. I felt bad that he saw me deciding to give them away. I kind of liked them but not enough to keep them in light of everything I had there. At some point the scene shifted and we were still in the same apartment but it now seemed as though we were clearing out the remnants of someone who used to live there for us to move in. There were things hanging on the walls that needed to be removed. Some things I would decide to keep and either not remove or rehang after thinking about it. In the kitchen there were cabinets full of white/see-through plastic containers and I gave away the containers and everything. There were also quite a few small wooden cabinets for lack of a better word, that had lots of little compartments and such. They were each made to house certain types of items. I had removed one from the wall, examined it carefully, and then replaced it deciding to keep it. I then decided to keep all of the similar ones. There were also two or more refrigerators. They had containers in them but no food. I gave away all but one of them, containers and all. The one I kept seemed to fit nicely into a kitchen cove. It was smaller than a conventional home refrigerator and it was brown. As we continued to clear things out I decided to put all of the artwork in one place together and I would not go through it until after I had the furniture I wanted and placed where I wanted it. Then I could better decide which artwork I wanted to keep and had the space to hang. There was a lot of artwork and I really liked most of it. We continued to try to find the living room and dining room pieces that I wanted to keep and get them placed where I wanted them. I wanted to gather the pieces into the appropriate room and then have Mother help me decided where to place things for the best aesthetic results. For some reason I was focusing on completing the dining room first, but was definitely focused on the living room second. we thought we were almost done and then realized that my bedroom was still full so we began working on it.

         "I dreamed that I had another baby. It was a little girl too and I guess it looked a great deal like my daughter did when she was a baby. When I came home, I came home to a funny place. I don't know where it was. But an old woman who used to look after me and my brother and my sister when we were about 6, 7 and 8, had come to help me take care of my new little girl. She was about the same age as she was then, which I guess was nearly 50. I decided the new baby would sleep in this little crib we had just the way that my daughter had for quite a while. I wanted to fix it up so we would be sure she would never slip out of it. I had this idea of tacking screen sort of humped around the edge of it to sort of form a cocoon-like thing that you slip her into and you could put the blanket on the outside of it and it wouldn't bog down around her and yet she would be protected from drafts at the same time. Also she couldn't fall out of the crib. This old lady who was there didn't think that was a very good thing to do. I was wondering what to name our little girl because we hadn't much thought our second little baby would be a girl and we hadn't thought of any names. I thought of naming her Bonnie, which is my sister's name, but I didn't really know if I liked that or not. Then it seems I was going with my new little baby and my next door neighbor. I was in my university town and I was going over to campus. Exactly why I was, I don't know. I think she had to do something in the language office there since her husband is a graduate student in Spanish. I was just more or less going with her. When we got there, the professor that I had for French last semester was there. Somebody told them to look at the baby. So he was looking and I was asking what name I should give it. He didn't particularly have any ideas. He didn't look like a professor looks in real life at all. He looked more like the doctor I was working for in the Biology Dept. right before I had my daughter. At any rate, he took me out in the hall and started congratulating me on the final that I did in his class, and how good it was and how hardly anybody else had done any better. Of course, this made me feel very good because I consider this professor the best that I've ever had anyhow. I told him, which is so, that I wanted to audit one of his courses next fall. He said that would be fine. Then I went back into the office and there were on a little table, there were several samples of some rock, they called it jade. It wasn't really jade. It was some form of quartz, more like opal. This other girl was ready to go, but I was sort of attracted by this display, and I wanted to stay and look at it for a little while, but we left. I believe that was all of that dream or else it faded into this which is a very independent sort of thing in which I was at home in my hometown, that is, with this old friend of mine from grammar school and high school that I never particularly liked. We were over in the high school where I had gone to school, but it was different. It had been so long ago that I had been there or something or they were in a new building. We were in some part of the building, and we went into a little room where we were going to study for a quiz or something. This was the math building and it seems she was majoring in math. I thought that was a little strange, but we went out for something. I didn't stay in there for only a couple of minutes. I don't know what we were going to do, but we went upstairs somewhere and she said she was going back to get our books. I would have gone back with her, but I didn't feel much like running back, then coming back here and running up the stairs and everything, so I said I'd wait right there, and she said she'd be back in a few minutes. While I was waiting, I noticed this boy along the wall right in front of me, and it also went around the corner and continued on down. This was the math part of this building, but I also think there was a science part, and I think this corridor led toward the science part. I started looking at this display, which was very strange. It was made up of incidents from a science fiction story which in the dream I had read, but in actuality I don't believe I have. It was of various things. There was a picture of the solar system. There were sculptures of this and that, all sorts of things. It was sort of confusing. I was looking at it. It occurred to me that I had been watching it for some while. This girl hadn't come back, and I figured she had probably just gotten her own books and had gone. It made me sort of mad and upset me because I wasn't at all sure of my way around this building and I wasn't sure I could find my way back to the room we had been in, but I went down the stairs and started walking along, and there was this man. He was evidently an instructor or professor walking along, and he had a limp. I walked along beside him and told him I was looking for this room, but the first room which had double doors that we came to I opened and looked. Then I noticed there were booths as though it was some sort of restaurant or something. So I went on and looked in several rooms. None of them were it. Finally we came to the end of the hall and then I found a room which I opened. It didn't much look like the room we'd been in, but I thought it just had to be. But there were painters in there painting and there wasn't any sign of any books. So I asked them if they had seen any books, and put them away when they had started painting, and they said yes, they had. I asked them where they had put them. They had put them in a back corner when they had already painted under this canvas. So I said when could I get them because I need them right now, that it was very urgent. So they got them for me. When they got them for me, the scene sort of changed and there was a counter there and this woman had gotten the books. I was with some friend now, this friend Edna of ours from N.J. This woman was showing my friend these books and saying look, what fine books these are. And they were magazines. It seems as though they were copies of some we had taken or are taking. There was a copy of Science, Atlas, and some other strange magazines which weren't very impressive. I was telling her and this American Indian who had appeared somehow on the other side of her, about his article that appeared in one of these magazines about Indians. There was a very complicated game in one of these magazines. It was a game that really I didn't understand, but I had played one round of it or something with somebody. In the game there were three, it was a piece of paper, in this case it was a page in a magazine, in which there was a square formed by three figures of various types of people or in various, not exactly situations, but you could infer what type of people or what type of action they normally engaged in by the pictures, and there were three figures across and three down, so there were nine in all. The object was to get to one of these and to get there, you would mark over them or something in your choice, and you were supposed to have these figures end up in the form of a cross such that the figures in all parts of the cross represented how the one in the center had come to be the way the one in the center was. It was a very, rather confusing. It was very clear in the dream. This particular one that I had ended up with somebody who was crucified and it was an Indian. The Indian by friend's side said that I seem to understand perfectly how somebody came to end up this way because of the ones I had chosen to go along with it. I said that I was going to show him this article in this other magazine that I had which was about a certain tribe of American Indians and their ceremonies, which included a sort of ritual crucifixion, only it wasn't. It wasn't with nails or on a cross; it was on a tree. I was finding this article for her and I think that was the end of the dream.",

         "Lucidly Pursuing Ray Jackson  I'm near a soccer field on which two teams are playing. One of the teams is supposed to be a lot better than the other. That team scores a goal very quickly: minutes after the game has started. There is a young player on the team named Jeff. He is very cocky. I go up to him and call him over to the side; He isn't playing at the time. I warn him that though he is a good player he needs to put a little more effort into his sport: to not slack off, but keep honing his skills or he may suffer the consequences. He leaves the area with his girlfriend. He may be wearing a blue jersey. The announcer comes over the loudspeaker with the scorer and time of the goal. He then says that Jeff has been kicked off the team. I walk up a path away from the field. It's difficult to walk: I go slowly, and limp. I move in slow motion. I walk by an open, fenced in area, on my right; maybe tennis courts. I can see people sitting inside the area, but can't distinguish them. I walk by a group of people on the side of the path. A woman with long blond wavy hair waves at me. I wave back at her without stopping. I pass another, smaller, group, where an identical looking woman with long blond hair says hi to me. I say hi back to her without stopping. I think the blond women may be identical twins; they are very pretty. A strong collie-like dog with orange/gold/brown fur prances around. I call the dog, but it won't strictly follow me. It runs up to a small hill on the path and stops, turning back. When I get up to the hilltop I see that down below is a zoo. Two large black bears are being trained for photographs. The dog was scared, so I go on a different path off to the right. I walk down in an area where trees have been cut and the stumps remain in a field. A house is on my right. I job briskly down this downward sloping path. I'm on a wooden path, and I hop briskly from log to log. The dog goes its own way, up the slope to the right. I walk on and come to a wooded area. I think I see a deer, and slow down, realizing it would be spooked already if it were a deer. I slowly walk and do see deer. I see a four-point buck with a large rack, 12-15 inches high. I also see a six-point buck. The deer seem to be everywhere! I see eight to ten very large deer, at least 180-200 pounds each. They dash away as I approach. I watch. I continue on through the small forest and enter a shack. There are three men in the warm shack, which is adorned with antiques on the walls: very cozy. One of the men says he started work at the shack today, which is a little cafe/supply store. They ask me if I have land around here. I tell them yes, thinking that the Ramos' land is around here, but then I realize I'm in New South Wales. I talk about the deer I just saw, and they say it's a good thing this is a shotgun hunting zone (because the shack is so close). There are many deer around, and since my friends the Ramos' and I are to hunt in a few days, the prospects look good. The working man says he has two kids that are hiding behind the counter because they've never heard a shotgun blast before. I leave. I'm in a very old pickup truck with two men my age, one on each side of me, two older men, and one or two younger kids. We drive. I want to make it to a football game where my housemate Glen Ryan is. I need to find the Dark Green Stadium where the game is being played. I may somehow get there in the truck. The man on my right pinches my thigh/butt. There is not much room in the truck: we're packed in standing. I grab his hand and tell him to stop. He continues to pinch my thigh and butt, and gets the man on my left to pinch my thigh and butt on the left side. I'm fed up with this. I punch the man on my left squarely in the nose with my right fist, and then elbow the man on my right. I yell to be let out of the truck: I'm in the company of mid 1900's rednecks! The driver stops and I get out, grabbing my green and red sweatshirt. The man that was on my right gets out after me. He it tall and strong, with short, neatly combed hair: a homegrown farm boy! We fight. I think that he has the size and strength advantage. I punch him three times in the testicles with my left hand and smash his face into the truck and ground while I hold the back of his head with my right hand. The other man my age gets out of the truck. I punch and beat him as well. I then hurry away from those hillbillies for fear that they may pursue me. The area I walk in is an old 1950's city, but fully functioning. It's being built at the same time. It is cloudy. I walk or jog along a road, hopping over logs, kitchen plates, and armchairs that are lying around because of the construction. A sidewalk is being built. The white cement looks modern in contrast to the old-fashioned town. I get to the football stadium and enter. The bleachers don't go up very high: it's an old stadium, uncovered. As soon as I enter the quarterback of the driving team makes a long pass that goes over the end zone and nearly hits a lady in the head as she walks out the door, about three feet away from me! I walk and look for Glen. The stadium is small and made completely of wood. It looks brown on the inside. Two men approach me, one on each side, and grab me. I am moved into a corner where one of the men stands in front of me. He is wearing gray. The other man takes a photograph of the man and I with a camera that has a large lens on it: very high tech. They seem to do this to somehow get a false identification card because they're younger than I: about 16 years old. I wrap my right arm around the head and neck of the man in front of me and threaten to break his neck if he doesn't leave me alone. Several of their companions show up. One shorter man deems their behavior useless, and slices an identification card in half with another identification card. I continue on. There is not much space in the stadium. People sit on picnic tables. I walk by and see my grade school classmate Ray Jackson sitting at a table. Immediately I recognize that I'm dreaming because Ray is not in New South Wales with me: he's in the United States. I say out loud, \"I'm dreaming\" at the exact same time that Ray looks at me and says, \"You're dreaming\". As I say \"I'm\" he says \"You're\", and our saying \"Dreaming\" coincides. I float or fly backwards, away from the table where Ray is. I will myself to fly towards Ray, and I do. He is then outside. I fly left, passing through a window without breaking it, and fly after him. He flies faster than I: I can't catch up to him. He has honed and practiced his flying skills. I follow him distantly, flying over trees. I fly upwards into white clouds and fog. I can't see anything. I fly in loops, arching my back, like I am a roller coaster. I try to fly back down to the ground. I can't see myself. I may make it down to the ground, but if I do I can't get a clear image of the stadium or the people. I can't seem to stop flying, so I open my eyes (in real life).",

         "Interpret this dream: Lucidly Pursuing Ray Jackson  I'm near a soccer field on which two teams are playing. One of the teams is supposed to be a lot better than the other. That team scores a goal very quickly: minutes after the game has started. There is a young player on the team named Jeff. He is very cocky. I go up to him and call him over to the side; He isn't playing at the time. I warn him that though he is a good player he needs to put a little more effort into his sport: to not slack off, but keep honing his skills or he may suffer the consequences. He leaves the area with his girlfriend. He may be wearing a blue jersey. The announcer comes over the loudspeaker with the scorer and time of the goal. He then says that Jeff has been kicked off the team. I walk up a path away from the field. It's difficult to walk: I go slowly, and limp. I move in slow motion. I walk by an open, fenced in area, on my right; maybe tennis courts. I can see people sitting inside the area, but can't distinguish them. I walk by a group of people on the side of the path. A woman with long blond wavy hair waves at me. I wave back at her without stopping. I pass another, smaller, group, where an identical looking woman with long blond hair says hi to me. I say hi back to her without stopping. I think the blond women may be identical twins; they are very pretty. A strong collie-like dog with orange/gold/brown fur prances around. I call the dog, but it won't strictly follow me. It runs up to a small hill on the path and stops, turning back. When I get up to the hilltop I see that down below is a zoo.

         "Wes S is back again already. He is married but planning to divorce his current wife. This is his second marriage. Someone tells me that he has five children. I am quite surprised by that. Both his first and second wife knew of me, just in terms of my being a woman that he has always had some kind of feelings for, or some interest in. His second wife appears very young, she's petite, and has long blond hair. She knew less about me then his first wife, Julie Sa, because she had never seen nor met me. When I met his second wife for the first time she said, ahhhhh, so you are Anna. She went on to say that Wes S has always loved me and that she had heard so much about me. She also said that I was the only one that he ever really wanted to be with. He was not home at the time. It was late at night so she invited me to spend the night there. She was sharing a bed with their two young daughters and said I could sleep there as well. We were all for sleeping in that bed when Wes S came home. His birth family is a very prominent wealthy family in the community. He is divorced and living with his parents in his birth home. It is a very large, old home, but very well maintained. All of the woodwork inside is painted white as are the doors. There is a small foyer type area probably not much more than four feet in diameter, but is more octagonal in shape. I'm standing in this area turning around and counting all the doors. There are seven. I realize that one of them actually isn't a door but just looks like it, two are doors and two are closets, and the other four are doors to different rooms of the home. I am now in a large open room and his mother comes in. She appears very young and energetic for her age, with blond hair and a warm and welcoming smile. As she sees me, she raises her hand and waves and she says you must be Anna. She also says that she has heard so much about me and she is so glad to finally meet me. I tell her that I am also very glad to finally meet her. She is very warm and friendly and treats me like her own daughter. Wes S and I are planning to marry, and he and his family realize how frightening that is for me. They are being very warm, kind, and comforting, trying to help me feel less afraid. Wes S tells me that he may be interested in having a child with me. I am taken aback by this comment, partially because he already has five children, and partially because of our age. While I know I don't want any more children, I'm also afraid to tell Wes S this because I don't want to lose him again. I start thinking that it might not be so bad depending on how involved he is as a father. His mother tells me a story about a time when Wes S was younger and he had come home from a social event. He had several pages in his hands, each one with the words to a different song. He was flipping through them and when he got to one of them, he pulled it out and put it on the top of the stack. She asked him if that was the song that he danced to with me. She said he bashfully nodded his head yes, and went to his room. I am helping Wes S bring Christmas decorations downstairs to decorate inside and outside for the holiday. There is an area that almost seems like a small store yet has very few things in it to sell. I am slightly rearranging those things to make room for the Christmas decorations the young girl who was working there seems irritated by this. I try to disrupt things as little as possible. Wes S, his most recent wife, and I are on a road trip together. We have been driving for quite a while. It's early morning as we approach Las Vegas. Someone mentioned something about finding a place to stop for breakfast. I tell them that I was just recently at Las Vegas with my son and my brother and we found that many of the casinos offer breakfast buffets. His ex-wife looks at me with a disapproving look. I don't know if it's because she doesn't believe me, or because she doesn't want to go somewhere like that for breakfast. I was with mother and we were shopping for my wedding dress. At one store, I was trying on traditional white wedding dresses. I tried on several that had empire with waistlines and the bodices were very decorative with beads and sequins. I said something to someone working there about preferring a style with an empire waistline and an A-line skirt. She corrected my pronunciation of the word empire. I was thinking to myself that the first-time empire dresses were in fashion was before she was even born and before Stacy London had her own TV program telling people to pronounce it differently. However, I said nothing, and simply tried to remember to pronounce it her way. After trying several of the dresses on, there were three that I wanted to try on a second time because I was sure that one of those three was the one that I wanted. I still had to decide between the three of them and I wanted to be sure. It was getting close to time for the store to close, so one of the workers had begun carrying all the clothing to the back room. We couldn't find all of those three dresses again. She did find one of them, and helped me put it on again. I stepped into it but was having a very hard time getting it up over my hips. Mother told me that it was too small. I reminded her that I had no problem getting it on earlier. I continued to wiggle it one side at a time until I got it on. The girl who had been helping us also said something. Mother started looking at dresses on some of the other racks and found a gold beaded dress that she thought would look nice. I looked at it and agreed to try it on thinking that it wasn't so bad. I now had on a gold top and a pair of black pants. I ask the sales girl where the skirt was that went with this top, as I had it on earlier. She didn't seem to know what happened to it. I went to the back and looked at a few more of the formal dresses. I remembered that I have said for some time, that the next time I get married I intended to where a very elegant silver formal gown rather than a traditional white wedding dress. This store didn't have anything like that, so I decided to leave and look elsewhere. I am driving alone around the area of LS Mall. I realized, as I go to my right and across three lanes, that I am driving very dangerously and I need to be more careful for other people. I feel badly about the way I was driving. I turned right onto what I believe is an entrance road to the shopping mall. As soon as I do, I realize that I turned at the wrong place. I continue driving through parking lots hoping that I can get to the mall without going back on to the main street. While zigzagging around a number of buildings and parking lots I do finally get to the mall parking lot. I am with a young girl who used to work at a women's clothing store. She feels sure that this store will have exactly what I'm looking for. We walked into the store and it was empty. There were no racks, no merchandise, and no people. She makes the comment that they shouldn't be running the store this way. I'm confused, because it doesn't even appear to me to beat a store. She walks through a dark doorway and I follow her. It takes us into another empty room, where she again walks through a darkened doorway at the back of the room that leads us into yet another identical room. Each time she enters one of these room she looks around to see if one of the employees are there. Each time it is just another empty room. This happens at least a dozen times. The rooms are not all in a straight line, making it feel a bit like a maze. This makes me feel very uneasy and claustrophobic. I'm getting very nervous. We finally enter a very large room that looks like a large office space full of individual cubicles. There are women working at several of the cubicles who see us come in and acknowledge the girl that I am with. She says something to them about no one being around and about the fact that she brought me there to look for a wedding dress.",

She says something to them about no one being around and about the fact that she brought me there to look for a wedding dress.\nSymbols: - Divorce: Divorce dreams may reflect real-life events and the stress that divorce can bring.

         "I started out running some kind of errand for CAS on my way to work. I started out going across town as though I was going to visit Jennifer K. At some point though I headed downtown. I was at a place where there were two lanes in the street going each direction. There were a lot of parked cars along the sidewalk. In some places there wasn't enough room for another car to drive in the right lane, where I was. Yet, I somehow managed to get by without getting into an accident and without hitting any other vehicles and without being hit. There were a couple of times that I didn't know how I managed that. At one point there were a lot of big puddles of water in the street and another time it seemed as though it was piles of snow. Later it seemed that I was on a bicycle instead of in my car. At that point I was trying to figure out how to get to Jennifer K's from downtown. I was at an intersection. There were a number of men standing there. Some of them were smoking cigarettes. One of them asked another for directions. I wondered if I should ask the same man for directions to Jennifer K's. I hesitated and finally decided not to. Then I was riding my bike down this street. It seems that the other people were walking. I was having a really hard time getting traction on the snow and ice. I think someone behind me realized that I was struggling to get traction and so, and I'm not sure if it was a man or woman though I think it was a man, they pushed me until I was in a place where there street was clean and dry so I could get traction. I wanted to turn around and say thank you but I knew I wasn't good enough on a bike to be able to do that without stopping or losing my balance. I decided that I would have to just yell thank you and keep going but I don't recall actually doing that. I kept going and got to a point where I stopped again because I wasn't sure where I was. I thought that if I could get to 38th and Kessing well twice I was trying to figure out how to get to 38th street. I knew I could get to Jennifer K's from there. I was at 38th street but I didn't know the cross street so I still wasn't sure. I kept going and I finally got to a point where I thought I knew where I was. There were a couple of women or girls standing there. I asked them to clarify where I was. The one who answered me made it more confusing. I finally said, Yes, but if I go over this bridge then there's a McDonald's to the left and what used to be a T.J. Maxx store and there is a movie theater to the right. She looked at me oddly. She said, McDonald's yes. T.J. Maxx I don't remember ever being there. The movie theater, yes. I thought, Ah. I know where I am then. That's where the SFI store used to be. I didn't say anything else to her. I got back on my bike and headed back out. I was still lost. I ended up in this place where there were some people who worked for a candy company. They were delivering these boxes of candy to these different stores. I ended up by a very odd little store. It was as though it was located at the top of a ramp and it seemed to be kind of an open-air place. I don't remember there even being doors on it. It was a store full of snacks and candy and stuff. There was a box of this candy there. Someone came in and asked if they knew if this was supposed to be for them or for another store in their company. The man who was working said he had no idea. This candy was a combination of candy and ice cream packaged together. Like two separate things packaged separately and then together or attached together. I left there and ended up in this place where some women were working around a lot of boxes of furniture. They were involved in remodeling an office. They had twelve pieces of each of these different kinds of furniture. They all looked alike. Some woman came up and was talking about a round table that was there. She said she didn't want that in her office. The other women told her that every office was supposed to get it. She said, Yes. But I don't want it. They said, Okay. That's fine if you don't want it. I think they gave me directions too, because I think I was still lost. I got back on my bike and started out again. Then I ended up at a place where there were three men working. They might have been construction workers but I'm not sure. They were working on something where they were attaching pipes to each other or to something else. They had copper colored pipes. The things they were using to attach them were copper colored kind of rubbery pieces but yet they clamped them tight to hold the pipes together. One of them was explaining this to me and I said, Yeah, it's an okay job. I saw that it wasn't clamped tight enough in a couple of places and I kind of use my thumb to peal it back. I thought it wasn't going to work very well. He kind of laughed at me as though I didn't know what I was talking about. I just ignored it because it wasn't that big of a deal to me. I was actually there to ask them for directions and telling them where I was trying to go. They said, And you're on a bicycle? I said yes. They said, Why don't you let us do you a favor and take you there? I almost cried at that point because I was so frustrated and I really didn't want to be on my bike anymore and I didn't want to keep trying to find it and not being successful. I said, You would do that for me? He kind of looked at me like, Well, Yeah! Kind of like, why wouldn't I? Then this other man said, Excuse me. I got the impression that he was maybe the supervisor and it was up to him to make such a decision. I looked at him and he said, That's fine. We'll be happy to do that. I said thank you. I started talking to him. I really liked him. He seemed really nice. The other man seemed like the kind of man that comes on to every woman that crosses his path. The other man seemed like a genuinely nice man so I talked mostly to him. Then I thought, You know. I wonder if he would just take me home. I'm so tired and frustrated. Even when I talked to the women I almost cried because I was so frustrated. I realized that I would have to tell him where I live and they will probably say something like, You mean you got all the way over here from there on your bicycle? But I just thought how much I really wanted to go home. I was going to ask him if he could just take me home.",

         "Mother and BJ wanted me to have my annual check-up at a hospital other than SVH's. I went to satisfy them but was very upset the whole time. they wanted me to partially undress and have the rest of my exam in these area where passers-by could see me. I got very angry and decided to leave. I was hurrying around looking for my winter coat and handbag. They were saying things like I was overreacting and being silly. I just grabbed my things and left. very angry. As I left I saw, through a window accessible to all, a pregnant woman being examined. I went back to SVH's. I parked my car in a lot four blocks away. I was with someone but I don't know whom. There were several cement walls about waist high. It seemed to be in a bad part of town. The environment was not at all like SVH North Campus. not the surrounding area or the building itself. I went to the elevators to go to an office but I'm not sure where I was headed. It was a six-sided self-standing elevator. that is, not encased in a wall. The outside was all gold and very ornamental. I wanted to go to the 2nd floor. The elevator closed without me so I grabbed something on the outside and let it carry me up one floor like that. Meanwhile, other people were waiting on the first floor for the standard elevator. I'm not sure if I got where I was going. I was walking around and noticed there were a lot of people around. It now felt more like we were in a hotel lobby. I realized there was some kind of trade show or something going on. I decided to go check it out. While I was walking in I realized all of the vendors were just setting up. I was going to look for the WDF booth and thought that I should call someone and see if Marcia N could come and work the booth. As I was walking around I saw booths for people like CFC, only they had a different name now. I realized they had merged with another company and changed their name. Then I saw my own booth. I realized then that WDF did not have a booth and that I had forgotten I had signed up to do this. I went over to my booth space and the only thing there was a three-panel cardboard background that someone had placed there for me. It was very unprofessional and sloppy looking. It had two handmade signs that had been made by Jane Cr for one of my Happenings programs. They were cloud shaped and had been written using several colors of markers. I was thinking about what I would need to get set-up. The booth next to me was just the same, I think it was an insurance agent. I knew her. She was asking me what I typically do for these shows. I explained to her and then told her I was just on my way home to pick up materials before the show starts. My booth was in a corner. Don H was running the show. I told him I needed a table and tablecloth. He took a corner table piece and tablecloth from another booth. I grabbed an extra chair that didn't seem to be in use. The other vendor also had ice and soft drinks which I accidentally moved an ice cooler and a big bowl of ice to my booth. I went and returned them. When I came back someone else had placed cups of ice and 2-liter bottles of soft drinks at my booth. I realized whoever was sponsoring the event was placing them at all the vendors booths for the attendees. I was thinking about what literature to bring and how to make the most of this show. I thought I would offer a free mini interpretation for people and then have those names to add to my mailing list. I also realized that I might need to print and create some materials at home before I returned. I was aggravated for not being prepared already. Two people who were attending the show came to my booth before I could leave to get my materials. I talked to the two of them a bit. I told them I normally charge $50 for a dream interpretation but today, they could sign up to get a mini-interpretation done free if they signed up for the mailing list. The younger woman immediately wrote a check for $15. Apparently she misunderstood me. Her check was like a business check. I realized instead of giving the interpretations free at this show that I should sell them for $15. That way I would make some money for it and they would have more value for the show attendees because they had paid something for it. I was glad this had happened when it did to inform my decision. I was looking for something to write on to give her my name and address, as I didn't even have my business cards with me yet. The woman she was with, I think it was her mother, decided to have one done too. While they were doing that they had a little dog running around like crazy. I was trying to stop him so I could pet him. At times he would kind of jump up on me, on my leg because he was so small. He reminded me of Janet C dog that I called a rat dog. About the height and length of a cat, yet smaller body. Very short haired. He was dark brown and black. When I left to get my materials it was pouring down rain. I wondered why I hadn't brought my umbrella in with me. I bent over and was protecting my head with a paper. Along the way I realized that even though it was raining very hard, I didn't seem to be getting wet. I got to my car, went home and came back. Again I forgot my umbrella. When I got inside I realized I had only picked up one of quite a few things that I needed and that I needed to leave again. The woman in the booth next to me had changed our booths so she had the corner spot. I switched them back. When she came up she said something to me. I told her I paid for a corner booth because it is better exposure. I guess I must have walked away because when I came back she had taken over the corner again. This time she had moved in all of these big items for an elaborate display. I was sandwiched in between her and another large display. I now had one straight table and it was sitting sideways to fit in between the other two. You couldn't even see my display. I found Don H again and was very upset about this. I told him I wanted it fixed and wanted my corner back. He tried to explain to me why she needed the corner and that it had something to do with client privacy. I don't remember my response, but basically I wanted my corner back. I told him that he had about an hour to fix it. He said he couldn't believe I would say that. I explained that I simply meant I had to go home to get the rest of my materials so he had an hour to figure something out. The woman in the insurance booth was ignoring me now- obviously she didn't want to interact with me after what she had done. The man on the other side of me was trying to make me feel better about my space. I overheard Jane Cr and someone else saying that wasn't right what was happening to my space. They acknowledged that my service is very popular to people and that it deserved the right space. I left again to go home and get materials. It was still raining very hard and I wondered again why I had not remembered my umbrella. Again, even though I was simply holding a paper or something over my head I noted that while my body was not protected from the rain it was not getting wet. This time I couldn't find the lot where I parked my car. I went to it from the other side of the block but then the surroundings weren't familiar so I couldn't find it. I came across several businesses, some with overhangs where I could be protected from the rain for short periods of time. I think one was a hotel and two were fast food restaurants. I think one was KFC. I don't know what the other was. I was getting very frustrated because I couldn't find my car. I finally went to the other side of the block, thinking that I should be able to find it that way. I think I did find the right lot just before I woke up.",

The woman she was with, I think it was her mother, decided to have one done too. While they were doing that they had a little dog running around like crazy. I was trying to stop him so I could pet him. At times he would kind of jump up on me, on my leg because he was so small. He reminded me of Janet C dog that I called a rat dog. About the height and length of a cat, yet smaller body. Very short haired. He was dark brown and black. When I left to get my materials it was pouring down rain. I wondered why I hadn't brought my umbrella in with me. I bent over and was protecting my head with a paper. Along the way I realized that even though it was raining very hard, I didn't seem to be getting wet. I got to my car, went home and came back. Again I forgot my umbrella. When I got inside I realized I had only picked up one of quite a few things that I needed and that I needed to leave again. The woman in the booth next to me had changed our booths so she had the corner spot. I switched them back. When she came up she said something to me. I told her I paid for a corner booth because it is better exposure. I guess I must have walked away because when I came back she had taken over the corner again. This time she had moved in all of these big items for an elaborate display. I was sandwiched in between her and another large display. I now had one straight table and it was sitting sideways to fit in between the other two. You couldn't even see my display. I found Don H again and was very upset about this. I told him I wanted it fixed and wanted my corner back. He tried to explain to me why she needed the corner and that it had something to do with client privacy. I don't remember my response, but basically I wanted my corner back. I told him that he had about an hour to fix it. He said he couldn't believe I would say that. I explained that I simply meant I had to go home to get the rest of my materials so he had an hour to figure something out. The woman in the insurance booth was ignoring me now- obviously she didn't want to interact with me after what she had done. The man on the other side of me was trying to make me feel better about my space. I overheard Jane Cr and someone else saying that wasn't right what was happening to my space. They acknowledged that my service is very popular to people and that it deserved the right space. I left again to go home and get materials. It was still raining very hard and I wondered again why I had not remembered my umbrella. Again, even though I was simply holding a paper or something over my head I noted that while my body was not protected from the rain it was not getting wet. This time I couldn't find the lot where I parked my car. I went to it from the other side of the block but then the surroundings weren't familiar so I couldn't find it. I came across several businesses, some with overhangs where I could be protected from the rain for short periods of time. I think one was a hotel and two were fast food restaurants. I think one was KFC. I don't know what the other was. I was getting very frustrated because I couldn't find my car. I finally went to the other side of the block, thinking that I should be able to find it that way. I think I did find the right lot just before I woke up.\nSymbols: - Building: To see a building in ruins or damaged indicates that your approach toward a situation or relationship is all wrong. You need to change. Your own self-image may have suffered and taken some blow.\n - Doorway: To see a bricked-up doorway in your dream implies that you are shutting yourself down from the world. If you are inside the bricked-up doorway, then it represents your sheltered life. If you are outside the bricked-up doorway, then it means that there is a deep secret that you are trying to prevent from coming out. Alternatively, a bricked-up doorway is similar to a locked door and signifies missed or denied opportunities.\n - Pregnant: Dreaming of a pregnant belly being violently ripped or cut open implies that you are unprepared for the new changes in your life. You feel that you are thrown into a situation that you cannot control.\n - Abduction: To witness an abduction in your dream signifies feelings of helplessness.\n - Ambulance: To see an ambulance full of wounded passengers signifies a fear of letting go your old Self and making space for the new you.

         "I'm at a camp somewhere - it's not just a resort, I seem to be learning something, doing practical things. All I know about it is the outside is nice; I'm kind of liking it here, but I've had about enough of it now. There are a lot of people here, some of them I know, some I don't. If it's not Sunday morning right now, then it's Sunday afternoon, and this guy who is like a counsellor - at least he's not just a participant either (we seem to have some official capacity, let's put it like that - we're not running the place, but we're not altogether guests, either) - and he has come back from somewhere. I expected a friend of ours to be with him; a young man who's kind of like Javier, in a way - he has that place, he's about the same age - sort of the new guy who's really good and everybody likes him and he's always around. And he's not with him and I'm wondering where he's gotten to. He's been off somewhere like to the store or something, on an errand into town, maybe. So I ask about him, and he says that he got called away, there was something he needed to go back for, and mentioning that it's about time I went back, too. He has a Sunday paper or there are some Sunday papers just now brought in - one of them is the Herald, of course, it's nice and clean and new and fresh, like Sunday papers start out - and of course I want to see the Lottery number, so I get hold of the paper and start looking in the front section. There's the comics the way they usually are, but usually for the weekday pages, inside the section, and they're also black and white (which the Herald's aren't at the moment) - anyhow, I don't get to the number before something else happens. This paper has a sort of a bug stuck to it - it falls out, and it's not just a bug; it's a ball of bugs. It's as though a bunch of these beetle-y sort of things have clubbed up together - maybe they've done this to hibernate, or something (I don't know why they would do such a thing, but they have), and they look dead; they look all motionless and dry. But just the same, even dead, I don't want to mess with bugs, so I figure I had better get rid of it. And it's a real challenge to scoop it up - the thing is maybe almost baseball-sized, real big bugs; they're orange, and shiny, and they literally are sort of side-by-side grouped together, making, mostly, a ball. There's a lot more than 5 or 6 of them, I should think. Now, I've decided I've got to take this thing away, of course, and so I scoop it up on the paper. The thing is, I don't do it quite there - for some reason, I have now decided to carry it to my mother's - so the next thing I'm aware of is being at her house. She isn't there; I'm curious about that and wondering when she's going to get back. [This is not my mother's house as it is in the real world] - this is more nearly like my grandparents' house - it's middleaged-old and has this \"rustic\" garage to it, that has your basic up-and-down door - it's cobwebby and musty in there, and somewhere along the line I've become aware of another ball of insects. This must have been at the house - I don't know where it came from. I've been into the garage, thinking I was gonna go into the house through it, and realizing they weren't there, went back outside to see what I could see there, and gone up on this sort of little porch, maybe to a side door of the house - it's right next to a large bush/tree - there's lots and lots of plants all around the house, in this nice summery sunshine, hot and all that - and this is where the other bug-thing comes into play. It's definitely alive - although I might have suspected that it was dying. I decide I had better get rid of it altogether, so I'm going to get a shovel and pound 'em apart. I go into the garage again, and first I see a short spade and pick that up - realize it's kind of small, look around again a little bit, find a real shovel, a long one with a good-sized blade on it, go back outside, and I find these things, and when I start pounding on 'em, it seems that I've got the short spade in my hand after all. Well, that's silly. So I put it down, pick up the shovel - which I have in fact got with me - now one of these things, that was up on the porch, seems to have been coming to life, sort of. That is why I got disturbed and dropped it. It was like it was giving birth to another bunch of bugs, which may have been in fact the case; on the bottom of the ball something looked like it was trying to break out of it, and I decide, \"We got enough bugs!\" (Don't ask me how I know that these were undesirable bugs, but that was my conclusion.) I am back here, starting to find the thing and pound the snot out of it, which I do. I'm sitting next to Nancy Gaines with a young girl who is sitting in front of us - we're with another bunch of people - she doesn't know us - we're visiting (and we may be sharing the LT, I'm not sure - but it's something we're there for that's new and unknown to these other people) and we haven't been entirely accepted yet. She's so far been nice to us, that's good - she's blond, looks like a nice kid. Nancy is (doing something like tying her shoelace) and talking about Kathy Carson - her name comes up in some way, and the girl says something like, \"Who's Kathy?\" We say one or two things about her, and I say, \"...and Nancy's gonna marry her!\" And Nancy says, \"Yeah! (something something) we're going to get married.\" The girl is looking at us askance - she doesn't say anything, and I realize that this may not have been the most opportune moment to say that. But we did say it, and I go on to say something about what the girl has been talking to me about earlier. She has perhaps written a letter or something, - maybe it was poetry - maybe she was telling me something - all I know is, I know something from her that the others don't know, and I'm talking about her and how this is so interesting, and I quote from her a bit. The 2nd thing that I say from her that's a quote, I suddenly realize, \"Oh, hell, this is a direct quote of something that's privileged information, that's real personal, and I have not asked her permission to talk about this.\" I am breaking confidentiality, and I am thoroughly ashamed of myself. I feel myself getting hot, and I'm sure I'm turning red, and I just feel mortified; looking at her, I'm saying, \"I am really, really sorry - I did not mean to do that.\" Of course, she not realizing that I have a code of confidentiality at all, looks to me like she doesn't really understand what I'm so disturbed about, and that it really was okay with her. And she doesn't know that it might not have been okay with her - it hadn't occurred to her. I am really, really sorry about it.",

         "In this dream I play the part of an Air Force hero. I remember that as I'm shot down, I think to myself, \"I have won every single award, but this last one is the wounded astronaut award. Now I will certainly win it because I'm seriously wounded.\" Next scene seems to be I am recovered by the Air Force in an attempt to save my life, but they somehow fail and I'm declared dead. But in truth I'm not dead. I'm _____________ and I appear to be dead. At the graveyard with all military honors I'm being buried. My wife and child are standing slightly down from a small hill on which I am being buried. There is a group of six military men from the different services lowering my casket into the grave. On my casket is like a small window. One of the military men, I think a Marine, shouts to the others that he sees smoke from the window. The window is becoming clouded up. By this he means that I'm still breathing and alive, so they quickly pull the casket back up and someone leans over close to me and listens or something and they discover that I am alive. They call the commander that was right nearby to tell him. An ambulance is brought and I'm rushed to the hospital and they discover that there's only one kind of a piece of equipment that can save me. It's some kind of a huge electronic resuscitator of some kind. This is now night. The only place that has it is right nearby, but it belongs to one of the other military services. It was in a warehouse and they need it immediately. No one can be contacted immediately. It will have to be taken, stolen from them. So a small group of Air Force men, about 6, rides over quickly to the warehouse where it is. Before this happened, however, the commander was informed that I would need some special equipment and at the moment he was informed, he was sitting in his limousine. The person who was informing him was leaning through the window speaking to him. Then he said in response that he didn't understand why that was so because the meat was good enough for them, and by them he meant 2 chimpanzees he had with him that he pointed to, and the man leaning in the window said, \"I'm afraid you don't understand. He needs thus and so.\" I guess he named the piece of equipment or described the seriousness of my illness to him. He said, \"Oh, that's something else.\" Apparently he gave the order to these 6 men to try and steal this piece of equipment. These 6 men pull into the front of the warehouse, the doors of which are all open and the warehouse looked more like a hangar, but it was being used for a warehouse. In front of the warehouse there were 5 men from this other service playing some kind of a game. One of the 5 was a giant. He was about 7 _ or 8 ft. tall and the men looked at one another and said, \"Well never get through them,\" because the 6 of them, the Air Force men, happened to be kind of slightly built. These other men are Army men. They were kind of building a human pyramid of sorts, but not quite. It was less than a human pyramid and they seemed to want to be able to walk in this position that they had gotten themselves into, with one man on the other man's shoulders and those 2 men somehow supported by other men. I forget how. The big giant was helping to get something done. He was lifting one man up and putting him on the other. So they proceeded to walk about 3 or 4 ft. and a couple of the Air Force men walked over. Several of the Army men turned toward them and growled, \"What do you want around here? Don't get near here. You better stay away from here.\" They said this with a great deal of anger and threat in their voices, so that the Air Force men just shrugged their shoulders and walked away. Then more Army men seemed to appear and it seemed as if it were time for a coffee break. They started whistling a tune that they all were sort of marching to, not marching, but they were just kind of keeping step. There must have been 12, 13 or 14 of them. They strung themselves out about 8 long and 2 deep. Right around there in order to keep step there were several that would skip one step to get back in step with the rest. As they were going through the hangar door, some of them were skipping steps just to keep in step with the rest of them. At this point their heads were sort of bend down watching their steps. This was when one of the Air Force men picked up the tune and started whistling it and kind of walked thru another door. They were walking thru a door at a 45 degree angle, thru these huge doors and half the line was in the door and this other guy, this Air Force guy, walked thru the adjoining door and ended up right in front of the line. As he did so, he skipped a step and continued to whistle with his head down so that nobody noticed him. About 2 seconds later 3 or 4 more Air Force men skipped into step in the back of the line whistling and thus they had succeeded in entering the warehouse in order to get this piece of equipment and that's where the dream ended. The commander's or the general's chimpanzees were dressed and they must have been cold because the general himself had a heavy winter blue overcoat on. The chimpanzees I don't know what they had on. One had a white blouse on and as he said the words that the meat is good enough for them, he was looking out across the front of his limousine into the surrounding scene, which was an air field. It was seemingly located near a large body of water which was partially frozen over with big chunks of ice in it. His limousine was also Air Force blue. The main character or hero was me. I felt that at one point in the dream I was somewhat Walter Middy-like. My wife and child or children, I'm not sure, were dressed all in black, and the small mound or tiny hill on top of which I was being buried was covered with very green grass. I'm not sure if I mentioned this, but I had been shot down while in my plane somewhere, apparently in enemy territory or something. I wasn't really very aware of the enemy. The Army men in front of the warehouse, which was all lighted up inside, had T-shirts on and their olive drab pants, pants to their work clothes. The tune that was being whistled was one line of music and it almost sounded like classical music, but it could have been anything. It's very clear, but I don't recognize it. There was an earlier part to this dream concerning my adventures as this Air Force hero of some sort, but I can't seem to remember. Just this week, Tuesday, I was going down to Homestead Air Force Base to make up one day's drill, at which time I noticed that there were a lot of Army men on the base. I asked one of the Air Force men why there were there. He said they were there for the Cuban crisis and they hadn't been moved yet. I was kind of surprised that they were still there. I think just yesterday or the day before the only bachelor astronaut got married and I just read something recently in two different places about chimpanzees. I don't remember what it was, though. I remember while I was at the Air Force base looking at a picture of the commander of one of the sections, thinking how ugly he was.",

Before this happened, however, the commander was informed that I would need some special equipment and at the moment he was informed, he was sitting in his limousine. The person who was informing him was leaning through the window speaking to him. Then he said in response that he didn't understand why that was so because the meat was good enough for them, and by them he meant 2 chimpanzees he had with him that he pointed to, and the man leaning in the window said, \"I'm afraid you don't understand. He needs thus and so.\" I guess he named the piece of equipment or described the seriousness of my illness to him. He said, \"Oh, that's something else.\" Apparently he gave the order to these 6 men to try and steal this piece of equipment. These 6 men pull into the front of the warehouse, the doors of which are all open and the warehouse looked more like a hangar, but it was being used for a warehouse. In front of the warehouse there were 5 men from this other service playing some kind of a game. One of the 5 was a giant. He was about 7 _ or 8 ft. tall and the men looked at one another and said, \"Well never get through them,\" because the 6 of them, the Air Force men, happened to be kind of slightly built. These other men are Army men. They were kind of building a human pyramid of sorts, but not quite. It was less than a human pyramid and they seemed to want to be able to walk in this position that they had gotten themselves into, with one man on the other man's shoulders and those 2 men somehow supported by other men. I forget how. The big giant was helping to get something done. He was lifting one man up and putting him on the other. So they proceeded to walk about 3 or 4 ft. and a couple of the Air Force men walked over. Several of the Army men turned toward them and growled, \"What do you want around here? Don't get near here. You better stay away from here.\" They said this with a great deal of anger and threat in their voices, so that the Air Force men just shrugged their shoulders and walked away. Then more Army men seemed to appear and it seemed as if it were time for a coffee break. They started whistling a tune that they all were sort of marching to, not marching, but they were just kind of keeping step. There must have been 12, 13 or 14 of them. They strung themselves out about 8 long and 2 deep. Right around there in order to keep step there were several that would skip one step to get back in step with the rest. As they were going through the hangar door, some of them were skipping steps just to keep in step with the rest of them. At this point their heads were sort of bend down watching their steps. This was when one of the Air Force men picked up the tune and started whistling it and kind of walked thru another door. They were walking thru a door at a 45 degree angle, thru these huge doors and half the line was in the door and this other guy, this Air Force guy, walked thru the adjoining door and ended up right in front of the line. As he did so, he skipped a step and continued to whistle with his head down so that nobody noticed him. About 2 seconds later 3 or 4 more Air Force men skipped into step in the back of the line whistling and thus they had succeeded in entering the warehouse in order to get this piece of equipment and that's where the dream ended. The commander's or the general's chimpanzees were dressed and they must have been cold because the general himself had a heavy winter blue overcoat on. The chimpanzees I don't know what they had on. One had a white blouse on and as he said the words that the meat is good enough for them, he was looking out across the front of his limousine into the surrounding scene, which was an air field. It was seemingly located near a large body of water which was partially frozen over with big chunks of ice in it. His limousine was also Air Force blue. The main character or hero was me. I felt that at one point in the dream I was somewhat Walter Middy-like. My wife and child or children, I'm not sure, were dressed all in black, and the small mound or tiny hill on top of which I was being buried was covered with very green grass. I'm not sure if I mentioned this, but I had been shot down while in my plane somewhere, apparently in enemy territory or something. I wasn't really very aware of the enemy. The Army men in front of the warehouse, which was all lighted up inside, had T-shirts on and their olive drab pants, pants to their work clothes. The tune that was being whistled was one line of music and it almost sounded like classical music, but it could have been anything. It's very clear, but I don't recognize it. There was an earlier part to this dream concerning my adventures as this Air Force hero of some sort, but I can't seem to remember. Just this week, Tuesday, I was going down to Homestead Air Force Base to make up one day's drill, at which time I noticed that there were a lot of Army men on the base. I asked one of the Air Force men why there were there. He said they were there for the Cuban crisis and they hadn't been moved yet. I was kind of surprised that they were still there. I think just yesterday or the day before the only bachelor astronaut got married and I just read something recently in two different places about chimpanzees. I don't remember what it was, though. I remember while I was at the Air Force base looking at a picture of the commander of one of the sections, thinking how ugly he was.\nSymbols: - Burial: To dream that you are burying a living person signifies emotional turmoil.

         "There were a large number of incidents that don't seem to be very well connected except that several have something to do with an impending invasion or war. One of the incidents that seemed unconnected with the war took place in a large house, and at one point I was standing by the entrance to a doorway and Brent, Lance, and I believe one of my other children were there, and one of them was crying because some of his possessions were stolen and he was saying that this particular boy must have stolen them because this boy was in the house at the time that this would have occurred. What were stolen were some small trucks. At another point I was standing in the kitchen of this house and it seemed as if there were another man and woman there, and some Englishman. The Englishman was performing some kind of tricks, and he said something like, \"Now I'm going to put some potato salad in the candelabra,\" or some other foolish thing like this. I asked if he would really do this, and the woman replied that he sometimes did zany things like that. I also remember being very hungry in this house and going to the refrigerator and taking out a slice of watermelon that was mostly white and had very little pink in the center. At another point I also took a loaf of frozen rye bread, put it down in one of the cupboards where the woman said that the bread should go. Then there was something to do where I felt ambivalent about taking more food from the refrigerator and it seemed as if the house now might have been the Institute. And I felt in some ways that I belonged and I felt in some ways that I were stranger to the building. I thought that these people might think it odd if I very freely helped myself to the refrigerator, but on the other hand I felt that I should feel comfortable enough doing so and I was very hungry. Somewhere along this time there was a letter that I was reading from Alan Sternberg and in it he was mentioning a visit that he had a couple of weeks ago with me. And in the letter he also mentioned Rhea, a girl that I know. Alan was planning a trip here a few weeks ago, but it never materialized. In the letter he was saying something about how friendly the atmosphere seemed at the Institute and I thought to myself that I must have been very skillful in not indicating anything about the tension that had existed between Calvin and myself lately. In most of the rest of the dream I seemed to be traveling by car up and down bumpy roads. At one point I pulled off this main bumpy road and parked in a little lane to the side. I stopped the car. Doris was up somewhere near the main road busily engaged in some activity and I was carrying on a conversation back and forth with her. I was seated by the right hand side, though, and the window was closed, and she had some difficulty hearing what I was saying very clearly. I tried to roll the window down, but had some difficulty because the winding handle was slightly broken. At another point there was a large pack of dogs near this area who were all traveling together, and I remember looking down the road and thinking that if the enemy did come now, then that would be signaled by all of the dogs starting to bark, so that they would serve a useful warning purpose. It seemed as if our dog were among all those that were running around. I drove down the road and parked again at another lane, and before doing so passed a sedan in which a man I had seen earlier in the dream appeared. For some reason I thought this a Western Reserve student who had done a dissertation with Calvin, and I thought it was Polster for some reason. Earlier in the dream it seemed as if he and I had jockeyed for some parking position, and now as I was starting to pull in this lane, he was parked there and wanted to start out from this parked position, but hesitated because there was a car parked behind me. When I pulled up to this lane, it went sort of up to a little hill like, and as I did, I noticed an elderly woman sitting in a parked car there. As I got out of the car, it now seemed as if it had turned into the Vespa and I remember kicking the stand underneath it. The place that I had stopped was near some house, and there were some signs saying \"Weird Incorporated\" as if it were some sort of haunted house. Off in the distance was the waterfront and there was a peculiar kind of dock that let out a short distance into the water. At the end of the dock it rose up into the air at a 45 degree angle and now playing on the dock was my son Craig. To get out to this dock I stepped out on a cement partition and then had to work my way around on this partition by holding onto a rather shaky trellis. There was also a thorn bush that I initially grabbed, but then by holding onto the trellis managed to work my way around this partition. After rounding it, I started to step across a ditch that was filled with water and had a board running down the center of this. The board looked like it was anchored, and I was hesitating whether to step on this board or whether to try and jump across this trough in one jump. I jumped over and as I did so, I heard some voices. The voice sounded like Gardner Murphy, and so I looked down to see who was talking. It seemed as if in the trough the water was not there now, and there were about 5 men dressed in costumes of the Revolutionary War period. One of them who seemed to be George Washington was speaking to Benjamin Franklin, and it was the Benjamin Franklin person who had the voice of Gardner Murphy. Washington was chewing him out about not having been prepared and hadn't he realized that he had to get more up-to-date with his methods of record-keeping and his economical planning and so forth. Franklin accepted this fairly well, although he was saying as had been implied, that he was completely unaware of these problems and had made some measures to deal with them. Something was said about sewers, and I believe it was at this point that there was another change in setting where a group of men were receiving instructions that the sewers were to be prepared because when the enemy came, this would be an important detail. There were a group of 5 men. Two of them got into a Jeep which began to back up, and 3 of them started to walk, heading out to the area which seemed to be some ditch that they were then to do something about, either putting in sewers or repairing sewers. As they left, they were wading through some water a couple of inches deep, and there were also a large number of hoses that were lying around in this shallow water. It seemed as if one of these men were a movie star, and it seemed as if it were Jack Carson. At another point up near the field where the dogs were mentioned earlier, I saw Brett and some other boy cutting grass in this rough field, and it seemed that I thought what they were doing was somehow connected with this war project, that by cutting the grass along the sides of this trough or gully that this was somehow preparing the way for the men who had been sent out to do the sewage job. The invasion which was supposed to be imminent was very vague except that everyone seemed to be expecting the arrival of a large number of men to appear. Some of the activities mentioned were to be in readiness for this attack. In the conversation with Doris in the car, one of the things that I was mentioning to her was that I was having a great deal of difficulty falling asleep. I told her that while I was being wired up, I was so sleepy that I could hardly talk to Max, and was yawning and that I had said something to him that when I went down, I would probably not be able to sleep.

         "I'm married to somebody, living in a house with kids (I guess they're mine) - fairly ordinary small house, Forties, Fifties maybe, not in great repair; I think there's maybe one of the kids home, otherwise just me. Right now I'm straightening some things up, I've got some old junk out to clean up or throw out, and it's cold in here, so I go look at the thermostat. It's on the wall next to a table [like mine really is] and it's coming apart. It's not even easy to read - parts of it are hanging down. I fiddle with it some and think maybe it's gone for good; I think I can read the temperature on it and it's set okay but is it really working? I'm not sure I can read what it really is. While I'm over there I knock a box of hair combs off the table onto the floor and one of them breaks. I see it between the table and the wall, and the ornaments came off and are lying face down - one of them as I pick it up looks like a dead spider and I drop it, then I reach for another bit that's definitely a feather and I realize that it was only a butterfly made of feathers. So I pick that up, and the comb, and the rest of 'em - they're all that plastic tortoise-shell stuff. I'm also taking some old bits of things with gunk all over them out of a box to un-muck, and these things I've got now are covered with wax like somebody burned candles in them. I can pull it all out at once - turns out they're some kind of levellers for furniture. We can maybe use them. I've also got quite a lump of wax/gunk here, kind of interesting. While I'm near it, I see a shape scurrying along the wall. I just know it's a rat or something equally nasty. I throw the lump of gunk at it (after moving chairs and stuff out of the way) and I may have hit it but didn't do it any damage - it scurries further to an open door that leads into the attic. So that's where it came from. It's gone out of sight, but reappears with a baby in its mouth. Now I can see it's not a rat but a possum [however, in the dream it really didn't look like one, it looked more like a prairie dog - I just called it a possum], not so dangerous but I still don't want it running around my house, especially not depositing babies. It freezes when it sees me, and I clap and shout to scare it. It jumps and jostles the opposite door, which leads into one of the boys' rooms. This is no great help but I don't know what else to do right now. In fact, people are starting to come in now - my husband's home, several friends are coming for dinner, kids home from school. I'm feeling up now, this is fun, cares are on the back burner, I'm chatting with a girlfriend in the kitchen - small kitchen, small house, but we're comfortable. My husband is nearby, telling stories and jokes, I'm feeling very affectionate toward him but we do have our differences. He's saying something about me, that he thinks is funny, about me being incompetent or something, and I think it's not only untrue but offensive. I look over to him and say \"I'm what?\" and he looks like, \"heh-heh, isn't she cute\"; I go over and face him and he says \"I was only making a joke\" and I get fed up and decide to leave. I'm tired of this kind of thing, it happens too much and I'm just not going to stand for it. Maybe I'll leave for good - right now I just believe I'll go out and have a good time - find a friend, have a drink, do my own thing. By coincidence, a woman I know is just passing and I hitch a ride with her. She's on her way somewhere but doesn't mind dropping me off - maybe Barbara will be home, and I'll stay there, or Linda. While we're driving along, we chat, and I'm still trying hard to remember the name of the blonde actress who used to do everything on TV in the 60's. I keep coming up with Madelyn Rhue, but that's wrong, and another name, but the right one won't come. We drive around a building that has a few shops in it, on the street; the corner one has a stucco front and a window above the main window and the door, and there's what I take to be a plaster ornament above the main window. It's a cat, a purple and white one - not dark purple, or quite lavender, but noticeable when you look. Only it's stuck on sideways, as if the wall was the cat's floor. However, now I can see the cat is real, a live, breathing cat sitting casually on the wall like nothing was unusual. It moves, it licks its paw, just like normal. I strain out the car to peer at it, and call to my friend, you've got to see this! So she looks, and we don't know what to make of it, and we go on. We come to a sort of tiny, sad-looking laundromat next to a matching sort-of 7-11 and stop next to an open vehicle with two men in it. One of them gets out and as he passes my side, he casually reaches in and lifts out a little round purse by its shoulder strap, which has been lying on the dashboard, and it's easily reached by the very front of the window, because the window's been broken out. I'm startled, and I say \"Wait! That purse, put that back!\" (or words to that effect) and my friend says \"What?\" and I ask her if that isn't her purse (she hadn't been watching), and tell her what he did. He's gone on into the laundromat and I get out and start after him and point at the car and say something to the other man (like, \"Isn't that your friend and didn't I just see him take that purse?\") and he starts to back the car out while the first one runs out and down the street. I'm verbally calling out descriptions of them and the car - it's a lot like a VW Thing or some form of Jeep but I can't see what for all the numbers painted on the back. I'm not even sure I can remember the license # for all the other stuff. I run behind and grab onto the back to get a closer look, then jump off. We go into the 7-11 thing, where they've seen all this and we're going to call the police. But suddenly the first guy (darkish, maybe Mexican, with a mustache) (the other had been bigger and handsomer, Caucasian with brown hair, looked pissed off while the first one had been swaggering and smug - both wore light short-sleeved shirts, the Caucasian one's a knit polo) comes bursting into the place and now he's got a gun, a revolver. I'm pretty shaken, but I get down behind a table and pull it up in front of me. He definitely wants to shoot me, that's what he's come back for, he's real mad. I say \"Do you really mean to kill me just for a little purse that probably didn't have anything in it anyway?\" I'm getting a real sober feeling that I'm about to get actually shot, maybe killed, and I sure don't like it but I'm determined not to panic. I'd rather get shot deliberately, knowing what's happening, than to panic and be desperately scared too.",

         "Interpret this dream: I'm married to somebody, living in a house with kids (I guess they're mine) - fairly ordinary small house, Forties, Fifties maybe, not in great repair; I think there's maybe one of the kids home, otherwise just me. Right now I'm straightening some things up, I've got some old junk out to clean up or throw out, and it's cold in here, so I go look at the thermostat. It's on the wall next to a table [like mine really is] and it's coming apart. It's not even easy to read - parts of it are hanging down. I fiddle with it some and think maybe it's gone for good; I think I can read the temperature on it and it's set okay but is it really working? I'm not sure I can read what it really is. While I'm over there I knock a box of hair combs off the table onto the floor and one of them breaks. I see it between the table and the wall, and the ornaments came off and are lying face down - one of them as I pick it up looks like a dead spider and I drop it, then I reach for another bit that's definitely a feather and I realize that it was only a butterfly made of feathers. So I pick that up, and the comb, and the rest of 'em - they're all that plastic tortoise-shell stuff. I'm also taking some old bits of things with gunk all over them out of a box to un-muck, and these things I've got now are covered with wax like somebody burned candles in them. I can pull it all out at once - turns out they're some kind of levellers for furniture. We can maybe use them. I've also got quite a lump of wax/gunk here, kind of interesting. While I'm near it, I see a shape scurrying along the wall. I just know it's a rat or something equally nasty. I throw the lump of gunk at it (after moving chairs and stuff out of the way) and I may have hit it but didn't do it any damage - it scurries further to an open door that leads into the attic. So that's where it came from. It's gone out of sight, but reappears with a baby in its mouth. Now I can see it's not a rat but a possum [however, in the dream it really didn't look like one, it looked more like a prairie dog - I just called it a possum], not so dangerous but I still don't want it running around my house, especially not depositing babies. It freezes when it sees me, and I clap and shout to scare it. It jumps and jostles the opposite door, which leads into one of the boys' rooms. This is no great help but I don't know what else to do right now. In fact, people are starting to come in now - my husband's home, several friends are coming for dinner, kids home from school. I'm feeling up now, this is fun, cares are on the back burner, I'm chatting with a girlfriend in the kitchen - small kitchen, small house, but we're comfortable. My husband is nearby, telling stories and jokes, I'm feeling very affectionate toward him but we do have our differences. He's saying something about me, that he thinks is funny, about me being incompetent or something, and I think it's not only untrue but offensive. I look over to him and say \"I'm what?\" and he looks like, \"heh-heh, isn't she cute\"; I go over and face him and he says \"I was only making a joke\" and I get fed up and decide to leave. I'm tired of this kind of thing, it happens too much and I'm just not going to stand for it. Maybe I'll leave for good - right now I just believe I'll go out and have a good time - find a friend, have a drink, do my own thing. By coincidence, a woman I know is just passing and I hitch a ride with her. She's on her way somewhere but doesn't mind dropping me off - maybe Barbara will be home, and I'll stay there, or Linda. While we're driving along, we chat, and I'm still trying hard to remember the name of the blonde actress who used to do everything on TV in the 60's. I keep coming up with Madelyn Rhue, but that's wrong, and another name, but the right one won't come. We drive around a building that has a few shops in it, on the street; the corner one has a stucco front and a window above the main window and the door, and there's what I take to be a plaster ornament above the main window. It's a cat, a purple and white one - not dark purple, or quite lavender, but noticeable when you look. Only it's stuck on sideways, as if the wall was the cat's floor. However, now I can see the cat is real, a live, breathing cat sitting casually on the wall like nothing was unusual. It moves, it licks its paw, just like normal. I strain out the car to peer at it, and call to my friend, you've got to see this! So she looks, and we don't know what to make of it, and we go on. We come to a sort of tiny, sad-looking laundromat next to a matching sort-of 7-11 and stop next to an open vehicle with two men in it. One of them gets out and as he passes my side, he casually reaches in and lifts out a little round purse by its shoulder strap, which has been lying on the dashboard, and it's easily reached by the very front of the window, because the window's been broken out. I'm startled, and I say \"Wait! That purse, put that back!\" (or words to that effect) and my friend says \"What?\" and I ask her if that isn't her purse (she hadn't been watching), and tell her what he did. He's gone on into the laundromat and I get out and start after him and point at the car and say something to the other man (like, \"Isn't that your friend and didn't I just see him take that purse?\") and he starts to back the car out while the first one runs out and down the street. I'm verbally calling out descriptions of them and the car - it's a lot like a VW Thing or some form of Jeep but I can't see what for all the numbers painted on the back. I'm not even sure I can remember the license # for all the other stuff. I run behind and grab onto the back to get a closer look, then jump off. We go into the 7-11 thing, where they've seen all this and we're going to call the police. But suddenly the first guy (darkish, maybe Mexican, with a mustache) (the other had been bigger and handsomer, Caucasian with brown hair, looked pissed off while the first one had been swaggering and smug - both wore light short-sleeved shirts, the Caucasian one's a knit polo) comes bursting into the place and now he's got a gun, a revolver. I'm pretty shaken, but I get down behind a table and pull it up in front of me. He definitely wants to shoot me, that's what he's come back for, he's real mad. I say \"Do you really mean to kill me just for a little purse that probably didn't have anything in it anyway?\" I'm getting a real sober feeling that I'm about to get actually shot, maybe killed, and I sure don't like it but I'm determined not to panic. I'd rather get shot deliberately, knowing what's happening, than to panic and be desperately scared too.\nSymbols: - Refrigerator: To dream that the refrigerator has broken down suggests that you need to warm up to somebody or some situation.

         "I was shopping in II with Stacey London and Clinton  Kelly. It was getting late. I went to Castleview Mall and only had about thirty minutes before the stores were going to close. Then we went to KATC. We had not bought anything yet. We were going through the mall. It had a very unique layout. The stores were similar to the very selective, upper class, boutiques you might find in New York. There was only one of each thing in the stores. Very sparsely stocked. Clinton was playing some kind of game in the ball, shooting at things. He continued as we walked out the door. He was shooting at something on the wall. Stacey had left a white, beaded hat lying outside on a partial wall next to the car. She saw that it had blown off and was lying on the ground. The other side of the wall was a very steep embankment. She was going to let it go but then saw an opening in the wall and decided to run down and get it. I was surprised that she was able to remain upright given how steep the embankment was. I didn't think we would be able to buy anything since the stores had closed. They said they typically don't finish in one day when they are taking someone shopping. They were going to spend the night at my house. My house looked very different than in waking life. It was very large and very, very modern. Sparsely decorated and all white. While we were shopping, Stacey had been doing the driving. After we finished and were headed back to my house. Clinton was driving and Stacey was sitting in the front seat next to him. While we were shopping, at one point Clinton had offered me his arm while we walked. I don't know why. I think because I was becoming so tired. After that, if I wasn't holding on to his arm, he was holding my hand. We were rushing to one of the stores and I was lagging behind. I told him he was just going to have to pull me, so he did. It did help me to move faster. When we were headed back to the house, Stacey was sitting in the middle, right next to him, and was leaning against him. She laid her head on his shoulder and he tilted his head down on hers. I saw them kiss and was confused and bothered by this because earlier it felt that he had a romantic interest in me. So, I didn't understand this. Also, I remembered that they said in an interview once that there was only a friendship between them. But now that appears to not be true. When we got to the house, I told them they could have my bedroom. Lara D is with us now. I told her she could sleep in Matthew's room and I would sleep in the living room. My home was all one floor. We were all so dead tired. So they each headed to the bedrooms and straight to bed as I headed to the sofa. I went through a window in the wall or something like that, into Matthew's room where Layne was. I told her she could pull the futon out into a bed but she didn't know how. I told her that there seemed to be a trick to it. I pulled it out for her. My bathroom was huge. It was bigger than a very large public bathroom. There was a row of stalls, but the stalls were about twice the size of those typically seen in public bathrooms. There were no doors on them either. There was a wall that came about halfway across the front but was only about three feet tall. The side walls were floor to ceiling. Everything is white. There is no color at all in this bathroom, the walls, fixtures and everything. Everyone was using the bathroom at once. No one seemed concerned about anyone seeing them in a stall. I guess because of the partial wall. I was uncomfortable with it, but soon realized they all seemed oblivious to anything anyone else was doing. Cal B is there now. We were all so dead tired. Stacey was planning to get up at 4:30 in the morning. Clinton and Lara D were planning to get up at 5:00. I decided to get up at 4:45 so we could stagger our times in the shower. Even though we were so tired, we were having trouble going to sleep. Stacey was not sleeping in the same room as Clinton. They seemed confused when I suggested they share a bed. I apologized and said that I thought they were in a relationship and would want to be in the same room. They said they weren't in a relationship. [Things aren't what they seem?] Clinton suggested I share his bed, though neither of us had any sexual intentions or desires, even though I think we did kiss a couple of times. Lara D had some people coming there for a meeting for her business. She was concerned about things being quiet and about being interrupted while they were here. At the end of the row of stalls in the bathroom, there was an area much larger than the stalls, though it was very private. That is where she met with these people. Stacey was having trouble sleeping so she decided to go through my closets. Lara D joined her. My closet had two levels of hanger rods. I had to climb on a chair to actually reach the hangers on the top level. I went in and saw some of the things they were throwing away because they were throwing away some things that I really liked and didn't see why they would have a problem with them. In particular, they threw away two suits that fit me very well, that fit me best of any I own. I was particularly upset about this. They were talking about how atrocious they thought they were. I climbed on a chair and started taking the hangers from the higher rod and hanging them on the lower rod so they could go through those things. We are all concerned that Matthew might wake them when he gets home, if they actually do get to sleep. Lara D is concerned about him causing a problem with the people she is meeting with, especially because he had a very young Andrew S and Todd A with him. I think he might have had one of my other nephews with him as well but I can't recall now. They finally arrived and were being loud. I told him that the three of them needed to be very quiet and he needed to make sure that the younger two were quiet. At first, they were very quiet but soon someone started making noise and this upset someone. I think it might have been Lara D that got upset. In one of the larger stalls there was a platform. The floor of it was as high as my waist. Andrew was sleeping there. He had his head covered up so I didn't know right away who it was. I think I said something to him about needing to be very quiet but I also told Matthew to find a different place for him to sleep. When I'm in the bathroom this time, I walked around the wall opposite the stalls and am surprised to see there is another whole row of stalls. Along one wall of this area is shower stalls and opposite the shower stalls are closets without doors. The rods are unusually high to hang things. Beneath the rod, maybe 3 feet off the floor there is a shelf, that has a border across the front making it more of a bin than a shelf. There are boxes sitting in most of these. Some of them have clothes in them and some of the clothes are still in dry cleaner bags. There are a lot of duplicates and they appear to have belonged to a group of high school children. I didn't really understand why there were so many duplicates, like six or seven of the exact same garment. I combined some of the boxes because they didn't have much in them. Maybe I was just organizing them. I was talking to someone about how nice it was to have all of this extra space back there, to have all of these stalls and open closets.",

         "My dream starts out with me being in the back of a sedan being driven by some teenager I didn't know. Several other teenagers were in the car and we were in some kind of a race on a track speeding around, and I was reading something at the same time. There was a good reason that I was in this car, but I don't recall that part of the dream that had the reason in it. I was kind of worried by speeding around like this, but I finally decided that the boy driving seemed to be pretty good and he knew what he was doing and we weren't skidding around or anything, so I just let him go on. Then this part of the dream made a transition by an action I don't recall into a part where there had been a group of humanoid aliens living here on earth. They were indistinguishable from humans in their appearance and they had been found out or such like that, so they had to leave earth. It wasn't any good for them to stay here anymore. They were getting ready to leave and were in their spaceship, all except for one girl who was finishing a last minute inspection or closing up the ports or something like that. I apparently knew this girl from an earlier part of the dream and I went up to say goodbye to her, I think, so I started going into this open port where she was in order to say goodbye, and then the dream changed such that going into this port, I was sticking my penis into her vagina from a rear entry position and this surprised me in the dream, the sudden change, and apparently surprised the girl too, both quite pleasantly and so she rolled over into the conventional position and yet somehow she was still the spaceship in a way. So her rolling over so we could get into a normal front entry position upset everything in the spaceship. It turned people over and rolled loose objects around and everything. Also, my penis inside her vagina sort of symbolically, well actually, pushing around objects inside the spaceship somehow. Then I don't recall whether we stopped having intercourse or whether we went on and had intercourse. Then because she had done this and upset the take-off plans or something, she was locked out of the spaceship, but she didn't know this. The people inside the spaceship, who now acquired a mechanical machine-like aspect, were treating her as sort of expendable portion of the machine and she was going about her tasks of getting the spaceship ready for flight, then couldn't get back in because the ports were locked. The dream scene shifted now so that I was home or whatever home was. This wasn't clearly defined, but it was someplace also from where the spaceship was. I sort of learned that the girl was locked out of the spaceship, so I was going to try and get over there and rescue her because if she was left like she was when the spaceship took off, she would be killed. Then it seems as if I intend to fly over to where the spaceship is. The spaceship is near a fair ground, incidentally. Then there appears what seems to be a comical interlude because I see this little red airplane taking off. There are a couple of ducks in the cockpit, although they're both sitting behind the pilot's seat. The male duck is behind the female duck, who is his girlfriend. Actually they're more like woodpeckers, kind of looked like Woody Woodpecker and his girlfriend. They're starting to fly without the canopy down and he closes the canopy down, but he closes it on her beak, so he opens it again. And while they're going thru this nonsensical action, a hole appears further back in the fuselage and an Indian sticks his head up and this is the last I recall of this comic interlude. It seemed quite funny in the dream. Then I'm in this car that I was in earlier in the dream with this teenage boy and we're racing along to the fairgrounds in this car. My worries seem to have shifted because now we seem to be trying to rescue my sister-in-law rather than worrying about this girl from this spaceship, which is forgotten about completely at this point. So we turn off the paved road onto this little dirt road which leads onto the fairgrounds. After going a little ways on this, there's a little house on the right with a couple of minor buildings connected to it and we stop here and the driver and I go into the house. The driver has now turned into the county sheriff. We walk into one of the first rooms and this very tall, husky man whose head is somewhat bald is sitting there and we sort of know that this man has murdered all sorts of people. And so the sheriff tells him he's under arrest and I sort of watch these whole proceedings. And the guy doesn't seem to resist or anything like that, but he gets up and starts taking us and a number of undefined others, who have come with us, around the grounds there, showing us where he supposedly has graves of his victims. The sheriff has a pistol that he's ready to shoot the man with if he tries to escape, and I've got a piece of chain in one hand and some kind of scrap iron in the other that I intend to hit the guy with if he tries to escape. So he takes us around inside and outside showing us these graves that you can't actually tell from the surface whether he's killed anybody or not, and he is just calmly describing these things. And finally he does escape from us somehow and we're running around thru the buildings -- which now seem to consist not just of a house, but offices here and there and one place a garage -- trying to capture this guy. Finally I'm going thru one hall looking for him and there's sort of a reception desk there with a secretary there and I ask her has he been this way, and she says, \"Oh yes, he's right in the lab across the hall there.\" I go down there and he's working on some sort of chemical or electrical thing -- I didn't see that too well -- with a young female lab assistant assisting him, and he just seems mildly disturbed that I've come in. I have some scrap iron in the end of a stocking which I swing like a club and I hit him with it several times, trying to overpower him, but it doesn't seem to bother him at all. He's a big man and apparently a very tough man. Then somehow he seems to speed up time, which puts him at an advantage against me. He takes me prisoner somehow and I'm quite angry at this and also quite worried about my sister-in-law cause I don't know if he's killed her and buried her or if there's hope that she's still alive yet. Then I drop out of the dream scene and it changes such that it shows there's an upstairs part, the building that this laboratory is in -- which I haven't been to or any of the other search party either -- and there is my sister-in-law along with several other females that this man has kept prisoner. They're up on a second story and they can't get out, and they don't even know that we're searching for them, even though we've gone past outside.

         "Interpret this dream: My dream starts out with me being in the back of a sedan being driven by some teenager I didn't know. Several other teenagers were in the car and we were in some kind of a race on a track speeding around, and I was reading something at the same time. There was a good reason that I was in this car, but I don't recall that part of the dream that had the reason in it. I was kind of worried by speeding around like this, but I finally decided that the boy driving seemed to be pretty good and he knew what he was doing and we weren't skidding around or anything, so I just let him go on. Then this part of the dream made a transition by an action I don't recall into a part where there had been a group of humanoid aliens living here on earth. They were indistinguishable from humans in their appearance and they had been found out or such like that, so they had to leave earth. It wasn't any good for them to stay here anymore. They were getting ready to leave and were in their spaceship, all except for one girl who was finishing a last minute inspection or closing up the ports or something like that. I apparently knew this girl from an earlier part of the dream and I went up to say goodbye to her, I think, so I started going into this open port where she was in order to say goodbye, and then the dream changed such that going into this port, I was sticking my penis into her vagina from a rear entry position and this surprised me in the dream, the sudden change, and apparently surprised the girl too, both quite pleasantly and so she rolled over into the conventional position and yet somehow she was still the spaceship in a way. So her rolling over so we could get into a normal front entry position upset everything in the spaceship. It turned people over and rolled loose objects around and everything. Also, my penis inside her vagina sort of symbolically, well actually, pushing around objects inside the spaceship somehow. Then I don't recall whether we stopped having intercourse or whether we went on and had intercourse. Then because she had done this and upset the take-off plans or something, she was locked out of the spaceship, but she didn't know this. The people inside the spaceship, who now acquired a mechanical machine-like aspect, were treating her as sort of expendable portion of the machine and she was going about her tasks of getting the spaceship ready for flight, then couldn't get back in because the ports were locked. The dream scene shifted now so that I was home or whatever home was. This wasn't clearly defined, but it was someplace also from where the spaceship was. I sort of learned that the girl was locked out of the spaceship, so I was going to try and get over there and rescue her because if she was left like she was when the spaceship took off, she would be killed. Then it seems as if I intend to fly over to where the spaceship is. The spaceship is near a fair ground, incidentally. Then there appears what seems to be a comical interlude because I see this little red airplane taking off. There are a couple of ducks in the cockpit, although they're both sitting behind the pilot's seat. The male duck is behind the female duck, who is his girlfriend. Actually they're more like woodpeckers, kind of looked like Woody Woodpecker and his girlfriend. They're starting to fly without the canopy down and he closes the canopy down, but he closes it on her beak, so he opens it again. And while they're going thru this nonsensical action, a hole appears further back in the fuselage and an Indian sticks his head up and this is the last I recall of this comic interlude. It seemed quite funny in the dream. Then I'm in this car that I was in earlier in the dream with this teenage boy and we're racing along to the fairgrounds in this car. My worries seem to have shifted because now we seem to be trying to rescue my sister-in-law rather than worrying about this girl from this spaceship, which is forgotten about completely at this point. So we turn off the paved road onto this little dirt road which leads onto the fairgrounds. After going a little ways on this, there's a little house on the right with a couple of minor buildings connected to it and we stop here and the driver and I go into the house. The driver has now turned into the county sheriff. We walk into one of the first rooms and this very tall, husky man whose head is somewhat bald is sitting there and we sort of know that this man has murdered all sorts of people. And so the sheriff tells him he's under arrest and I sort of watch these whole proceedings. And the guy doesn't seem to resist or anything like that, but he gets up and starts taking us and a number of undefined others, who have come with us, around the grounds there, showing us where he supposedly has graves of his victims. The sheriff has a pistol that he's ready to shoot the man with if he tries to escape, and I've got a piece of chain in one hand and some kind of scrap iron in the other that I intend to hit the guy with if he tries to escape. So he takes us around inside and outside showing us these graves that you can't actually tell from the surface whether he's killed anybody or not, and he is just calmly describing these things. And finally he does escape from us somehow and we're running around thru the buildings -- which now seem to consist not just of a house, but offices here and there and one place a garage -- trying to capture this guy. Finally I'm going thru one hall looking for him and there's sort of a reception desk there with a secretary there and I ask her has he been this way, and she says, \"Oh yes, he's right in the lab across the hall there.\" I go down there and he's working on some sort of chemical or electrical thing -- I didn't see that too well -- with a young female lab assistant assisting him, and he just seems mildly disturbed that I've come in. I have some scrap iron in the end of a stocking which I swing like a club and I hit him with it several times, trying to overpower him, but it doesn't seem to bother him at all. He's a big man and apparently a very tough man. Then somehow he seems to speed up time, which puts him at an advantage against me. He takes me prisoner somehow and I'm quite angry at this and also quite worried about my sister-in-law cause I don't know if he's killed her and buried her or if there's hope that she's still alive yet. Then I drop out of the dream scene and it changes such that it shows there's an upstairs part, the building that this laboratory is in -- which I haven't been to or any of the other search party either -- and there is my sister-in-law along with several other females that this man has kept prisoner. They're up on a second story and they can't get out, and they don't even know that we're searching for them, even though we've gone past outside. It's a foggy day and they couldn't see thru the windows that we were outside on the path.\nSymbols: - Car: To dream that you are driving a car denotes your ambition, your drive and your ability to navigate from one stage of your life to another.

         "I went outside, in the evening after dark, to do some yardwork. I was going to trim the yard and bushes primarily. I was thinking about how much I use to enjoy doing that type of work, and how therapeutic it can be. I went to my two shrubs and had decided to trim them myself since the apartment maintenance men had not gotten around to it in some time and they were badly in need of trimming. I realized this may cause me to have more shoulder problems, as when I pruned my lilac bush. There was something else about a lot of people doing this at their own homes but I don't remember that part. As I started trimming the bush to the left I realized it was almost completely dead and that I would call the office to see if it could be replaced. The dead branches were the rusty brown color that dead evergreens turn to when they die. I decided to go ahead and cut it all out now anyway, until they could get there with a new one. When I got to the second bush there were parts of it that were dead. I debated whether or not to cut the dead out. I wasn't sure if it would look worse to leave it in or take it out. I decided to go ahead and cut it out. After I did that I saw lots of tall weeds growing through that brush. I got down onto the ground, starting on my hands and knees and then eventually moving to a sitting position, and started pulling the weeds. Some of them were very large and thick but I was determined to pull them rather than cut them off so I could get the roots out. It seemed that the more I pulled out the more I saw. Some of them were a very bright lemon-lime color. As I was finishing up I was walking closer to the wall of the townhouse when I realized that all of my Canna flowers were gone also. I was stepping in very soft gooey mud. I was wearing my moccasins and I didn't want to get them all muddy, but I also didn't want to go into the house to change when I had so little left to do. I stepped back into the grass and scraped my feet in the grass trying to get rid of the mud before it dried on my moccasins. When I finished there was very little bush left. In the midst of this trimming, I saw four people heading to their respective cars on the other side of the street. One of them said something, which made me look. I think the child might have said hello to me and his father yelled at him not to do that. I went to the truck - not at all like any truck I've ever seen. almost looked like some type of armored vehicle - to say something to the father but he just pulled away. nearly hitting me. The other two people had gotten into a car in front of him and had already pulled away. I went and got a broom to start sweeping up the cuttings from the driveway. As I was doing so I saw a dead grey goat, a little older than a newborn goat perhaps, lying in the gutter at the end of the driveway. This was very upsetting. I didn't know what to do. I thought I would finish sweeping and then decide. I continued sweeping the clippings up the driveway towards the pile of clippings in the yard. As I did so, I found a dead deer in the driveway. This was even more upsetting. I made the same decision to finish first. As I did so I also found a dead cow that was white and caramel colored, and a black bear. I tried to sweep the clippings around them to the yard. As I was doing so the deer shook its head and stood up. Next the cow and then the bear did the same thing. The goat was, in fact, dead. I was stunned. But then they started talking. They were going to do something about the man in the truck and their purpose in life was to do something about other people like him. To fight unkindness and cruelty in the world. I wanted to join them and help them in their cause. At this point I was barefoot and I wanted them to wait until I got some shoes on but they didn't want to. It was cold outside and I didn't want to walk barefoot on the cement. Plus, I knew that you shouldn't do that because you might injure your feet. I decided to take my chances on catching up with them and ran into the house to put some shoes on. It seems as though I am a man now. The inside did not look like the inside of my waking life home. I hurried upstairs to get some shoes. My wife was there visiting with two other men. One was her father the other may have been a brother. My child was in bed asleep. The house was decorated for Christmas I was rushing around trying to find some shoes. I saw a slip-on sitting in the hallway. I tried to find its mate. I debated whether it was mine or not and whether it was a male or female shoe. I put it next to mine and decided that it would fit. I finally found the mate and slid it on. I ran outside. As I did this I realized that my wife would so love to do this and seldom gets the opportunity. I went back into the house and let her go instead. They got into a vehicle together and left. I am a woman again now, myself in waking life. I was sitting with three other women on my bed. The house was decorated for Christmas. We had all just awakened from naps. I started telling them about the dream I just had about the bushes. We were extremely surprised and excited to find out that all four of us had dreams with very similar elements, centered around the bushes. Three more women entered the room. [I only know one of the women sitting on the bed and can't think of her name in waking life-just that she was a member of JLI and was single when I knew her. Two of the women who just entered the room I don't know.] Marlene F was the third woman who entered the room. I motioned for her to grab the rocking chair and pull it closer. It had a dark green seat cushion on it. One of the original four had lay back down and closed her eyes. I leaned over and asked if she was okay. She didn't respond. I told the new three about the other four of us having similar dream symbols during our nap. Two of the three that had just joined us said they had the same thing. The one lying down now sat back up and said she had just lain down for a few moments to try to capture more of the dream. She said she needed to make a phone call ASAP. I told her we would take a break in just a few minutes. We started talking about the dream having some message about Christmas. Myself and a member of JLWA were both single and had very similar feelings and experiences about Christmas over the last few years. We have both lost our joy in the seasonal celebrations and events. We quit watching the holiday shows, and quit going to parties and community events. We discussed that we should do those things together. That we should both try to be the force behind the other when we don't feel like doing something we know we used to enjoy so much. Even if it is just watching TV specials together. I felt as though I was begging her to do this. She agreed that we should but did not agree to do so. A reporter walked in the room and wanted to know if she could observe and take notes. I made sure it was okay with everyone else. I told her we were getting ready to take a five-minute break and then we would reconvene. She seemed irritated. I was trying to be pleasant and told her that one of the women needed to make a phone call at this time and another needed something else and we would keep the break as brief as possible. She still seemed irritated and that irritated me. I didn't have to let her observe after all. As it turned out when we did try to reconvene the reporter had left because we had taken too long. We decided to call it a night. I was still trying to partner with me in a holiday effort but did not get a commitment from her. I was thinking about all the things that I could do myself to try to work towards my personal holiday goals.",

         "I was in a place that I had been before in a dream. I don't know if it exists in waking life. I was in my car on a four-lane street. It was very busy. I was in the far left lane. Cars from the street parallel to me kept turning into the lane that I was in. I had to keep getting over to avoid a front-end collision. One car finally ended up getting into a front-end collision because as I pulled over the car that was behind me sped forward and just ended up in the front end collision with the car that had turned into this on-coming traffic. I went ahead and got around them to get out of the way of the scene of the accident. But there was a school bus there that had pulled off to the side and was getting a tire repaired. So I had to get back over to the left then. Then I barely squeezed through between the bus and the car to my left without causing an accident myself. Then there was another, I think maybe it was a semi-trailer truck. I'm not sure what he was doing maybe making a turn. I was just barely able to squeeze by him to the left again without getting into an accident in between the truck and the vehicle to my left. Then there was one more time that I knew if I didn't really step on the gas and hit it I wasn't going to make it that time. I did just barely. Then for some reason I am walking. I am running, taking shortcuts through alleys and things. I end up in this really bad apartment complex. I hear police officers yelling. I think they are trying to arrest a drug dealer. I am very afraid of getting shot. I don't know where to go because I feel that I see young men running out of the apartment and yelling at each other and I feel like I'm surrounded and I don't know where to go. I finally dart to my left and see a subdivision of homes so I run over that way. It's just starting to get dark, like early dusk. I see these families setting up lawn chairs and stuff in the street. At first I wonder what is going on and then I realize that it is the weekend of the radio station's annual fireworks show. They are usually held on the bank of a river and synchronized to music. It's a really wonderful show. I finally decided to stop and ask someone the best way I told them that I'm trying to get home. I told them about getting caught in that apartment complex. One woman suggested she walk with me a little bit. She took me to this amusement park. They have a ride here. If you just get on this ride and stay on it to the end you'll almost be where you want to go. It was kind of like an alligator ride on water. You just grabbed one that had yellow on it. They were floating on the water and they had a pole coming up the middle to hold on to as you stood on it and floated along the river. During the ride people would get off at various points along the way. But the woman had told me to stay on it until the end and the man who was charge of the ride nodded yes to indicate that was fine with him. As soon as one with yellow came by she pulled it close enough that I could step onto it. I thanked her and nodded to him to indicate a thank you. I stayed on it to the end and so did he. Then there were four or five men, kind of young men, who agreed to take me the rest of the way. I don't know if it was in a car or not. I don't know why I would let them or why they went with me the rest of the way. When we got to my house there were a lot of people there. One of the five men was from another country or spoke a foreign language. I think he was just visiting the U.S. I wasn't able to communicate with him very well. He wanted to wash his hands so he was in the bathroom but he kept grabbing the wrong things. He grabbed a bottle of lotion and I said, No. That's lotion. Then I realized that he couldn't understand me. So I physically showed him. I squirted some soap onto my hands and then washed my hands. He then picked up the soap bottle and it just came out on his hands. I said, Here now rub them together. Again, I realized he couldn't understand me so I was showing him by action. Then there were these other two men. One was dark-skinned, maybe just a dark tan. I think he was American. The other was a pretty average looking man. They were saying they didn't want to leave and were very subtly flirting with me. Nothing crude or offensive. They were laying on my bed. I climbed up on my bed. I gave a very light kiss on the cheek to the one with the dark skin. I thanked him for helping me. They both got up and said they really had to go. The dark-skinned man left the room but the other one stayed behind. He was chewing on a straw. I kept pulling it out of his mouth, kind of jokingly but it was annoying to me. The last time I pulled it out of his mouth I gave him a kiss on the lips and thanked him for helping me. There was obviously some attraction there. Because after the first light kiss to just say thank you, then we kissed again and that one was a bit longer. I could tell he was very attracted to me. It was mutual. We both knew he had to go because his friends were waiting for him. We started walking out. We stopped again in a little hallway. This wasn't my waking life home. We stopped in this little hallway and kissed again. He said, I want to make love to you so badly. I just smiled at him. We walked out into the main part of the house. BJ and Bill F are both there. There are others but I don't remember who. Now it isn't my home. BJ was waiting for those men to take me home because they were also going to stop by a drugstore so I could get some corn pads for her. As we were getting ready to leave I asked her how she was going to get them. I asked her if she was going to give me time to get home and then come and meet me there and then come back here or were you hoping that I would come back here. She just looked at me with a half smile and I knew she wanted me to come back and I did not want to come back. For whatever reason I was really tired and I just wanted to go home. Then I said, I know. Bill F you have a vehicle here right? He said he did. So I asked BJ why she didn't just ask him to run him to the drugstore that is very close by and you can get what you need.",

         "Interpret this dream: I was in a place that I had been before in a dream. I don't know if it exists in waking life. I was in my car on a four-lane street. It was very busy. I was in the far left lane. Cars from the street parallel to me kept turning into the lane that I was in. I had to keep getting over to avoid a front-end collision. One car finally ended up getting into a front-end collision because as I pulled over the car that was behind me sped forward and just ended up in the front end collision with the car that had turned into this on-coming traffic. I went ahead and got around them to get out of the way of the scene of the accident. But there was a school bus there that had pulled off to the side and was getting a tire repaired. So I had to get back over to the left then. Then I barely squeezed through between the bus and the car to my left without causing an accident myself. Then there was another, I think maybe it was a semi-trailer truck. I'm not sure what he was doing maybe making a turn. I was just barely able to squeeze by him to the left again without getting into an accident in between the truck and the vehicle to my left. Then there was one more time that I knew if I didn't really step on the gas and hit it I wasn't going to make it that time. I did just barely. Then for some reason I am walking. I am running, taking shortcuts through alleys and things. I end up in this really bad apartment complex. I hear police officers yelling. I think they are trying to arrest a drug dealer. I am very afraid of getting shot. I don't know where to go because I feel that I see young men running out of the apartment and yelling at each other and I feel like I'm surrounded and I don't know where to go. I finally dart to my left and see a subdivision of homes so I run over that way. It's just starting to get dark, like early dusk. I see these families setting up lawn chairs and stuff in the street. At first I wonder what is going on and then I realize that it is the weekend of the radio station's annual fireworks show. They are usually held on the bank of a river and synchronized to music. It's a really wonderful show. I finally decided to stop and ask someone the best way I told them that I'm trying to get home. I told them about getting caught in that apartment complex. One woman suggested she walk with me a little bit. She took me to this amusement park. They have a ride here. If you just get on this ride and stay on it to the end you'll almost be where you want to go. It was kind of like an alligator ride on water. You just grabbed one that had yellow on it. They were floating on the water and they had a pole coming up the middle to hold on to as you stood on it and floated along the river. During the ride people would get off at various points along the way. But the woman had told me to stay on it until the end and the man who was charge of the ride nodded yes to indicate that was fine with him. As soon as one with yellow came by she pulled it close enough that I could step onto it. I thanked her and nodded to him to indicate a thank you. I stayed on it to the end and so did he. Then there were four or five men, kind of young men, who agreed to take me the rest of the way. I don't know if it was in a car or not. I don't know why I would let them or why they went with me the rest of the way. When we got to my house there were a lot of people there. One of the five men was from another country or spoke a foreign language. I think he was just visiting the U.S. I wasn't able to communicate with him very well. He wanted to wash his hands so he was in the bathroom but he kept grabbing the wrong things. He grabbed a bottle of lotion and I said, No. That's lotion. Then I realized that he couldn't understand me. So I physically showed him. I squirted some soap onto my hands and then washed my hands. He then picked up the soap bottle and it just came out on his hands. I said, Here now rub them together. Again, I realized he couldn't understand me so I was showing him by action. Then there were these other two men. One was dark-skinned, maybe just a dark tan. I think he was American. The other was a pretty average looking man. They were saying they didn't want to leave and were very subtly flirting with me. Nothing crude or offensive. They were laying on my bed. I climbed up on my bed. I gave a very light kiss on the cheek to the one with the dark skin. I thanked him for helping me. They both got up and said they really had to go. The dark-skinned man left the room but the other one stayed behind. He was chewing on a straw. I kept pulling it out of his mouth, kind of jokingly but it was annoying to me. The last time I pulled it out of his mouth I gave him a kiss on the lips and thanked him for helping me. There was obviously some attraction there. Because after the first light kiss to just say thank you, then we kissed again and that one was a bit longer. I could tell he was very attracted to me. It was mutual. We both knew he had to go because his friends were waiting for him. We started walking out. We stopped again in a little hallway. This wasn't my waking life home. We stopped in this little hallway and kissed again. He said, I want to make love to you so badly. I just smiled at him. We walked out into the main part of the house. BJ and Bill F are both there. There are others but I don't remember who. Now it isn't my home. BJ was waiting for those men to take me home because they were also going to stop by a drugstore so I could get some corn pads for her. As we were getting ready to leave I asked her how she was going to get them. I asked her if she was going to give me time to get home and then come and meet me there and then come back here or were you hoping that I would come back here. She just looked at me with a half smile and I knew she wanted me to come back and I did not want to come back. For whatever reason I was really tired and I just wanted to go home. Then I said, I know. Bill F you have a vehicle here right? He said he did.

         "I had taken a new job working for a retail business or a business that had a retail division to it. When I first took the job I was going to be working in a retail location and it seems that there were no other employees, just the manager. All of the previous employees had either quit or been fired. The ones who had quit did so because it was such a mentally and emotionally undesirable place to work. The others were fired either because they were incompetent or because they were causing problems about whatever was going on there. After the interview, I headed home. I was driving home on a flat piece of cardboard. I have no idea what was propelling it forward or what I was using to steer it. I have no image of anything other than the flat piece of cardboard. The cardboard was lying flat on the ground and I was sitting on it. It was moving forward just like any motorized vehicle. I was really in a hurry to get home, so I was going around 90 miles an hour. It was dusk or maybe even a little bit later. I was thinking about the fact that I was speeding. I hoped it wouldn't be a problem because the cars seemed to be going pretty fast. However, I didn't want to get caught by a police officer either. I think about what I'm using for travel and I think that there's no way that I would even be noticed because I'm so low to the ground. I couldn't get stopped if I wasn't noticed. I had hardly finished this thought when a police officer in the other lane, heading in the opposite direction that I was, motioned to me to pull over. The police officer was driving something that resembled a golf cart. He had two other people with him. One was sitting in the front with him the other was sitting in the back. Both of these were people that he had stopped prior to me. He started to write me a ticket and I begged him not to. I apologized profusely. I explained to him that I had been unemployed for nearly a year and I just really didn't have the money for a speeding ticket right now. He couldn't help but see that I was very distraught by this. Finally, I promised him that I would find a different way home that I wouldn't even get back out on the road tonight. At that point he decided to go ahead and let me go without giving me a ticket. He didn't even write me a warning. I walked back to the place that had just hired me. It wasn't open for business but the door was unlocked so I went back in. When I was there earlier the manager I was speaking with was a man but now it's a woman. I went in to see if there was anyone there who would be willing to give me a ride home. I thought there might be someone there who would be headed home soon and going in my direction. Then they might drop me off at home or drop me someplace close to home where I could walk the rest of the way from there. I had mixed feelings about doing this as I didn't want to impose on anybody, I certainly didn't want to give this impression to my new employer before I even started work. Since I had promised the police officer that I would find a different way home I didn't feel that I had much choice. I didn't know anyone else in the area that I could ask. At first I asked the woman manager. I don't know if she wasn't going to be leaving for a while or if she wasn't going to be going in my direction or maybe she just didn't want to. It occurred to her that there was another employee there, an older man. She suggested I ask him. He was a large man maybe 6 feet tall and a large build. I'm guessing he was about 70-years-old. He looked kind of rough, though not dirty or unkempt, but a bit scary looking. It's just the kind of appearance that in another situation I would have been hesitant to approach him and talk to him. He was doing janitorial work. When I asked him about a ride home he seemed very put off by the idea. I apologize for bothering him and I left. I decided that I would just need to walk home, even though home was on the other side of town. As I left the building I walked down some steps and onto the sidewalk. I realized that the sidewalk would be a shortcut and cut my time almost in half. The sidewalk straight in front of me continued for probably 100 yards or less. Then it turned to the right. After it turned right it continued for a long way. I knew at the end it would turn right again and I would just have a few hundred yards more to go before I was very close to home. I was carrying with me the cardboard that I was riding on earlier, except now it is shaped differently. Now it has four sides on it making it more of a shallow rectangular box. For some reason I lifted it over my head to carry it. I either did that so that I could see where I was walking better, or simply because it was going to be easier to carry it that way. It seems like maybe it was both. The sidewalk where I'm walking reminds me of walking through a park. There's a lot of grassy area and a lot of mature trees to my right. To my left there is a small width of grass and a few smaller trees between the sidewalk and the road. When I first start out, the road is at the same level that I am but the sidewalk goes uphill and the road to my left stays at the lower level. The street runs parallel to the sidewalk. As I'm walking I notice that I'm approaching a huge bridge. I had never noticed this bridge before. It is made of steel beams and girders but I'm thinking how beautiful it is. I don't think in waking life I would think that this is a beautiful bridge. It's very industrial looking it's built up on both sides with each side being a series of arches constructed out of steel beams and girders. I can't see the whole bridge. I don't know if that's because of darkness or fog. But the bridge seems to disappear on the end opposite of me. As I'm walking I see the woman store manager in her car pull up on the street alongside me, heading in the same direction that I am. She slows down and pulls off to the side and stops, so I stopped walking. She had decided to come after me and drive me home. I'm trying to decide whether or not to impose on her and allow her to take me home. There was also something about actually being on-the-job. I was one of the hourly employees, the only new one. The others had all worked there various lengths of time. Some of them had been there a long time and some had not been there long at all. I was talking with some of the other employees. It is a very negative conversation. At least some of it seems to be related to the employer. But they are also talking about some other employees, about something they do or have done. Some of it is not related to the business at all and some of it is. In another part, though, it seems as though I have been hired as part of the executive team. I attend an executive meeting and we are all in a very small rectangular room that seems to have low ceilings and is also not very big in square feet. As the meeting starts the room begins to move in one direction as though it's a vehicle. At the same time the lights become very dim. So much so that we can hardly see each other. I realize now that this is intentional. The room is a moving as though it's a trolley car. And it begins to go underground. It continues to travel underground while we continue our meeting. It almost seems that they do this to maintain secrecy of what is being discussed in the meeting. I, of course, find this all very odd and unsettling and I'm not sure what to make of it. It causes me to question things about the organization and their ethics or their business practices. I wonder if I even want to be a part of this organization.",

         "I was lying in a bed in a different room. The bed seemed to be at right angles to the one that this is, and someone came in who appeared to be acting as the monitor. It was a very tall, powerful-looking person. Then he said, after looking at me and thinking I was asleep, that it was disgusting, absolutely disgusting, that anyone would sleep to this late hour in the morning. He seemed to be dressed in some sort of military clothes which were rather bunched up and sloppy. The room had some very strikingly colored furniture which I think I had painted and I think the colors were red, black and yellow, very vivid. Then it seemed as if I didn't know what color the walls were going to be because now the walls were orange and green, so it made quite an intense kaleidoscope. There were two other people in the dream who I seem to know and they went off through one side of the room when they thought Dick Jones was coming. They were trying to hide from him, and he went along, it seemed, through the same door and then came down around another room and appeared at a door which would have entered into the original room, but there was an orange kind of curtain there and he became sort of irritated because he couldn't find these other people and was muttering something to himself. It seemed that this was somewhat more than in a playful sense that they were trying to avoid Dick, but I'm not sure what the situation involved. Then we were riding along in a car and Dick was driving. He was driving through extremely heavy traffic. It seemed I was sitting somewhere near the back of the car, but also it seemed somehow as if I were above the car or sitting on the roof because I could notice how extremely close, within an inch or so, he was passing near other cars. There were about 6 or 7 high school kids who were riding on horses in the traffic. The street (Clinton) involved here seemed to be back in Rochester, and every once in a while cars would have to turn off of the other side and that these times sometimes the kids on horseback would slow down and let the cars pass, and at other times they would try and gallop ahead, which made a great racket on the pavement as they would do so. These kids were all yelling and fooling around and obviously in a frisky kind of mood, and so I thought it was very inappropriate for Dick to be driving as fast as he was and to come as close to some of these horses as well because they could very easily turn sidewards because the kids did not appear to be very good horsemen. These kids were both male and female. As the kids came up behind us on horseback I turned around, half expecting to recognize some of them, because for some reason I thought some of them might be the nursing students. I think it may have been after the first scene that the following one occurred. I had woken up from a dream study and these two girls about 17 years old were there. I knew them both in the dream and seemed to be more attracted to one than the other. It seems as if the one I was most attracted to was more familiar to me or was a girlfriend or something. I kissed the familiar one in a very brief sort of pecking sort of fashion a few times and then finally kissed the other girl once or twice. The more attractive one seemed to have a very slight pot belly and blond hair, where the other one had dark hair. I was rushing around in a very animated fashion and kept sort of patting them and pecking them and saying, \"You got to stay awake now.\" It seems as if they had some sort of connection with the dream study and somehow in the dream it seemed acceptable, as if I would be a in different state of mind, and I was sort of taking advantage of this to pretend a great deal of excitement and energy, which then gave me an excuse to frequently shake these girls and then to kiss them. It seems there was a bed or something similar nearby, and I pushed the blond girl on the bed and kissed her. Then the other one was also on the bed, so I kissed her too. Then at one point I said, \"Let's try something. Let's have both of you lie as close together as you can, then I'll see if I can kiss both of you simultaneously.\" They agreed, and I remember had their faces turned toward each other so that it was possible to kiss them both at the same time. Then I jumped off the bed and said that I was getting rather excited and maybe we better do something else. In the next scene I was walking down the street with Doris and the kids. As we walked along, there was some girl sitting in a car, a high school girl, who said -- I'm not sure whether it was to me or to Doris -- that she was so glad she had talked to whoever it was because she had been thinking about going to North High School, and after talking to whoever it was, had been encouraged to go to South High, and she did and found it great there. She said there were a lot of others there too. It seemed as if she's referring to there's a lot of other Italians there as well. As we continued to walk down the street, we came to a very large Pure gas station, and off to the right was a building with people sitting up on the roof, and Marti Fromm was one of the people. It seemed as if she owned this building, and she and all the others, men and women, were sitting up there sunning themselves. There was a very large parking lot around this gas station, but I was sort of ignoring that Marti was sitting up there. I walked in and now it seemed like a restaurant and Nick G., an acquaintance from Rochester, was the head counter man. There was someone else there that I also knew from Rochester. They were kind of giving me a good-natured razzing about something. Then someone said I better check in the large refrigerator that was there and see if some of my food was there. It seemed that I had been shopping earlier and had a large number of groceries with me, and for some reason had kept some of them in this refrigerator. As the refrigerator door was opened, I was looking about at various things, trying to decide whether they belonged to me or not, or whether they belonged to Marti. Then Dorothy Pope from the Duke Lab was there and her hair was very gray and she wore it in a funny style where the part in the middle went straight back and the hair hung down directly at the sides. She said something about, \"You know how fussy Marti is about the food. She always feels that people are taking food from her, so make sure you don't take anything that would be hers. I said something about if there was any question, I would give her the benefit of the doubt, and leave the food there. At this point Marti appeared at the far end of the restaurant and glanced over toward us, but did not seem to recognize me and so I didn't say anything to her and she left. Another incident involved eating oysters. This one girl who was from my nursing class was there, and she was telling this other girl about having just bought some oysters. She said it was the simplest thing in the world. You just went to this store and gave the name of it, just bought the oysters and that was it. I was thinking about this in terms of the unusual taste that some people develop for food and thought that I had never eaten oysters, and I wondered what they would taste like and thought they must be fairly good because so many people seem to really relish them and go to great lengths to go to some oyster house and dip them in sauce and so forth. Estimated time would have been about 13 or 14 minutes. The two people in the early part of the dream trying to avoid Dick Jones were in their late teens and I think it was a boy and a girl, but I'm not certain.",

         "Interpret this dream: I was lying in a bed in a different room. The bed seemed to be at right angles to the one that this is, and someone came in who appeared to be acting as the monitor. It was a very tall, powerful-looking person. Then he said, after looking at me and thinking I was asleep, that it was disgusting, absolutely disgusting, that anyone would sleep to this late hour in the morning. He seemed to be dressed in some sort of military clothes which were rather bunched up and sloppy. The room had some very strikingly colored furniture which I think I had painted and I think the colors were red, black and yellow, very vivid. Then it seemed as if I didn't know what color the walls were going to be because now the walls were orange and green, so it made quite an intense kaleidoscope. There were two other people in the dream who I seem to know and they went off through one side of the room when they thought Dick Jones was coming. They were trying to hide from him, and he went along, it seemed, through the same door and then came down around another room and appeared at a door which would have entered into the original room, but there was an orange kind of curtain there and he became sort of irritated because he couldn't find these other people and was muttering something to himself. It seemed that this was somewhat more than in a playful sense that they were trying to avoid Dick, but I'm not sure what the situation involved. Then we were riding along in a car and Dick was driving. He was driving through extremely heavy traffic. It seemed I was sitting somewhere near the back of the car, but also it seemed somehow as if I were above the car or sitting on the roof because I could notice how extremely close, within an inch or so, he was passing near other cars. There were about 6 or 7 high school kids who were riding on horses in the traffic. The street (Clinton) involved here seemed to be back in Rochester, and every once in a while cars would have to turn off of the other side and that these times sometimes the kids on horseback would slow down and let the cars pass, and at other times they would try and gallop ahead, which made a great racket on the pavement as they would do so. These kids were all yelling and fooling around and obviously in a frisky kind of mood, and so I thought it was very inappropriate for Dick to be driving as fast as he was and to come as close to some of these horses as well because they could very easily turn sidewards because the kids did not appear to be very good horsemen. These kids were both male and female. As the kids came up behind us on horseback I turned around, half expecting to recognize some of them, because for some reason I thought some of them might be the nursing students. I think it may have been after the first scene that the following one occurred. I had woken up from a dream study and these two girls about 17 years old were there. I knew them both in the dream and seemed to be more attracted to one than the other. It seems as if the one I was most attracted to was more familiar to me or was a girlfriend or something. I kissed the familiar one in a very brief sort of pecking sort of fashion a few times and then finally kissed the other girl once or twice. The more attractive one seemed to have a very slight pot belly and blond hair, where the other one had dark hair. I was rushing around in a very animated fashion and kept sort of patting them and pecking them and saying, \"You got to stay awake now.\" It seems as if they had some sort of connection with the dream study and somehow in the dream it seemed acceptable, as if I would be a in different state of mind, and I was sort of taking advantage of this to pretend a great deal of excitement and energy, which then gave me an excuse to frequently shake these girls and then to kiss them. It seems there was a bed or something similar nearby, and I pushed the blond girl on the bed and kissed her. Then the other one was also on the bed, so I kissed her too. Then at one point I said, \"Let's try something. Let's have both of you lie as close together as you can, then I'll see if I can kiss both of you simultaneously.\" They agreed, and I remember had their faces turned toward each other so that it was possible to kiss them both at the same time.

         "I had a dream about sound last night, and now I've just got to remember what it was. We were at this place like Scenic Point or Becker Park, and they were having this kind of little festival thing with cupcakes and different little craft booths and different things going on. And there was this little area only reserved for VIP's and only VIP people could go there. And it had this little orange net fencing surrounding it, you know like they do sometimes at blockade sites. Well, there was a gap in the orange net fencing and Dad was putting bulb (?) and just ___ back there. We didn't know it was only for VIP's and we didn't have a pass, and once we got back there, everybody was very accommodating to us. And we went up on this deck and we saw like some sound equipment, like a couple mike stands and a couple amps and mixers and things laying around. And that was pretty cool, but then the deck was like the deck of like a house or something that had a door on the front, like the front door of a house. But when you went in this front door, it would be like really, really dark with only a little window at the top. And it was a narrow hallway, and it was deep. I mean, I should say it was a deep way down from the deck to the floor, and there was a window up high. The doors had windows in them. And the window light reflected against the wall and it looked gray. And we go down this tunnel. Well, first of all, in my dream I like was in a hurry to get in this door because there was a lot of sophisticated equipment in there, or so I thought. And I think this is an important part of the dream. And I went in the door and let it close behind me, I was so scared and petrified that it was so dark, that I opened the door and I waited a few minutes for Dad to come with me. And he came with me and we, it seemed a little lighter when he was there with me. And boy, I'm using up tape like crazy here. Why I can't stop stuttering and la la la blah. Oh well, anyway, it seemed lighter when he was down there, and there was some kind of a sound system in there that had a couple of subs that went, \"boom, boom, boom\" with some kind of rap beat, you know how it goes in those big cars? Except it wasn't that intense; it was about the level of mine, but it was just kind of isolated and not a whole lot of highs or anything else. And I thought, \"Hey, that's cool,\" and I had a feeling like it was like a testing site. And went down this hall and we came out. It led into like a nice little shop thing, and this shop had everything from like candy canes to little ornament ball things, to baskets of goodies and stuff. And I had a feeling it was like somebody's house, but it was a shop too, and there was a lady there that was real nice and kind and accommodating to us, and gave us something, I don't remember what, from her kitchen table, something like a sample to eat. And then we went out the door and we were back at the Becker Park place, and Dad said, \"Want to do that again?\" and I said, \"Yeah.\" So we stepped into the orange fencing, we went up on the little deck, I saw the equipment up on the deck, we went down in the little dark tunnel thing with the subs that were booming and went through the lady's little shop, and, hey, that was fun. It was like a round, round, round circle. We did it a couple times. And then I had Astrid with me and Dad, and I was leading Astrid up onto the deck and down into the little dark tunnel thing, and the tunnel thing seemed lighter and safer each time I went through it. I think that's symbolic. And this time I was leading Astrid through it, and I lead her, she wasn't scared at all, of course. Well, even though she couldn't see, she knew it was kind of dark in there and cramped and tight, and she didn't seem to have a problem with it. And then I led her into the shop thing, except it had transformed this time, and not only was it that lady's shop, it was like somebody's bedroom. And we were like snooping in somebody's bedroom and they had a whole stack of CD's and stuff, and Astrid was wanting me -- and all of these CD's were new, they were wrapped, like the shrink wrap. And Astrid was telling me, \"Tell me what this one is, tell me what this one is,\" and some of the titles I could read and some I couldn't. And just before I woke up, there was this CD that had the cover of like a green spider web, and it had white lettering on it that said \"50 cents,\" you know, like the rapper guy. And then I woke up. Man, that was something. And, you know, it's evening time and it stayed with me the whole day. Isn't that amazing! But I think this is kind of symbolic. In the past I have had a few dreams about a roundy-roundy-round circle that just is continuous, like, for example, I had a dream one time that a cellar went down into a sub-cellar that led out into a, like a netting tube that you would go up and get in the attic. And when you were in the attic, there would be a whole bunch of stuffed animals and it would be kind of hard to breathe in there. And you would have to fight your way through tons and tons and tons of stuff in order to get out of there. It was kind of like Mom's attic is. And then you would be in the house, and that was a circle that involved dark and scary places. Now this circle had a dark and scary place, but it was only one, and it involved sound, which makes me think about life when I analyze this. The fact that the tunnel seemed lighter and safer each time I went through it, I think has to do with experiences that are new and odd and scary. They seem easier each time I have the same experience, and I think the first time that I went in there when I was so scared and petrified and I waiting for Dad, I think some experiences are like that. I am afraid to do them on my own, and even though he's more critical and slower and harder, I want to have somebody help me through them. And I think the lady's shop symbolizes like a house, like almost being in a home-like environment. I don't know, I'm drawing a blank there. But the fact that I had Astrid on this round circle thing with me, I think is that I think I've had enough in the sound industry that I can start leading Astrid through it. And that's all I have to say for now. My throat is dry and I've used up enough tape. Another thing I thought of, I think the fact that we started out that an event at Becker Park or Scenic Point and going in that VIP section and people not minding us just barging in there has to do with the fact that coming into the sound industry in all this stuff, I started not knowing a darned thing and being at events like that, at public places, and wanting to go behind and wanting to just jump over those stupid fence things, and wanting to go talk to the people and they never really minded it. And that, inside the VIP fence is like inside another world. And I think -- I don't know if this circle was about life, or if it was about the other world contained in the sound industry, or whether it's about both. I don't know, but that's that.",

         "My husband and I were up in the mountains, and we were going to walk to this little town. We didn't know exactly how far it was. It was about 3 to 7 miles away. My husband's mother was in the mountains with us, but we were taking my daughter with us on the walk. The road that we were to take was the same one that I walked down in a dream some time ago, not very long ago, but it didn't start at the same place it was supposed to. In this dream I remembered having walked down it before. But I thought I would walk down it with my sister. So my husband and I started out down the road and I pointed out several places to him that I remembered as I walked along. It was a dirt road and winding and it had recently been widened. Sometimes we let our daughter walk and sometimes we carried her. We came to a place where several new houses were being built on either side of the road, very far from any town or anything these houses were being built. It was a Sunday afternoon and yet these people, the people who owned them or the people who were working on them, were out working on the houses. Now that I think about it, even though these things were going on, it was very, very quiet. There was no sound and all these people were just working and not paying any attention to us as we walked by. But we came to this place where these people were building apparently something right in the middle of the road. There was a high heap of gravel in the road, and this man and woman were standing on top of it, raking it, the mound, and smoothing it. Then down in front of it there was a very flat place that had sort of been cleared out, a rectangular form that probably extended under this mound of gravel itself. I was standing in this rectangular space looking at what they were doing or just sort of standing there wondering what the purpose would be. The heap of gravel was up almost to the top of my head, I guess. And finally the woman noticed me standing there and she came up very indignantly and asked me what I was doing there, standing on their fine whatever they were building. I told her I was sorry and I moved, but I thought the mounds were what they were building and not this other place. So my husband and I with my daughter walked around and these people were hosing this mound down. My daughter saw it and started wanting a drink of water. Then the workman at one of the other houses said we had better not give her any because the purity of the water around here was uncertain. So we got on back down the road, and there was some water from the houses going down the street. It was almost sort of a paved street. It was very wide going through a residential area. It seemed to be a regular sort of suburban area, although the streets were quite wider than you would expect. There were no cars around, no people except for a few children. It was a hot day and I sort of thought it would be fun to walk along in the water, and I thought my daughter would enjoy it. So at this point we were barefoot walking through it. We walked on through this part and we came to a big crossroad where a little dirt road came into a big and complex intersection. This was way out in the country, though. It wasn't in town because we left this built-up part behind us. I told my husband that this was as far as I had come with my sister. We tried to find a sign post to find out how far it was to the little town that we were going to, and we couldn't, but we figured it must be at least another three and a half or four miles, and we had already walked that far with my daughter. I decided that we just couldn't go on because it would be that long back again. So we decided to stop. This happened to be the Blue Ridge Parkway that we had come to. Being Sunday afternoon, there were quite a few people in this little wayside park beside the highway and there was also a refreshment stand open. So we went over and found a little table, which very conveniently had a small seat, a swing type thing for our daughter to sit in, and got some things to eat. Then my husband was going to walk back, get the car and come back and get us. So my daughter and I were going to stay in this little park till he came back. So I wondered what we were going to do all that time. All of a sudden I acquired all sorts of paraphernalia, equipment like binoculars, camera and a flashlight, and mydaughter was naturally tired and there wasn't very much to do in this little place. There was a strange interlude. There was a little rustic cabin set in this park and it was inhabited by a member of the Old West. Exactly who it was, I don't believe it was Billy the Kid, it might have been Wild Bill Hitchcock, sort of a venerable-looking person with this wife and a dog. And he -- it was very complex -- but he, I believe, had been bribed by this younger man or he was the younger man who had bribed the former acknowledged all western star, into letting him be known as this, by giving him a fine old dog that the man really loved. I believe this was the one who had given the bribe rather than received it. Now his wife was doing something fraudulent. She was, she had this old Indian recipe for bleach, and it was sort of ridiculous. She packaged it up in two parts; one was this sort of whitish powder and the other was a bottle of Clorox. You were supposed to pour these two together and then you would have bleach, sort of expensive. Obviously it was a fraud because it was the Clorox, not the powder, that had the bleaching qualities. So I talked to her for a while, or at least sort of tried to, and the wife was very sort of self-righteous about this. After all, it was the only way they could earn a living. I said to this man -- I think he was Wild Bill Hitchcock -- \"All these kids out there in the park would be glad to see you. Why don't you go out there and talk to them,\" and so forth and maybe, I didn't say this, but I implied that maybe the parents would give him some money so that they would have some more to live on. He said no, that nobody was interested in him anymore. More and more strange things appeared in this place all the time. Now right in front of his cabin there was a tent with an elephant in it. It just sort of took on a carnival appearance. There was also a duel in this, which I saw or it was rehearsed, but it actually happened. I was even one of the men in it. Between the man, the old star, and the young one who was now this old man, they had quarreled about something. So the old star said, \"Let's just shoot it out,\" and the younger man, who I became in the dream, and the old man, the young man stayed in the house and the old man went out. We were both supposed to start firing at each other until we had used up all the shots in our six guns or until one of us had killed the other. So we both started shooting and neither one of us seemed to be any good. I don't understand how we could have been heroes and stars of the Old West because neither one of us did anything. I was scared to death. We were supposed to stay in this one fixed spot that we were standing in, and I kept wanting to sort of duck and get out of it. I kept counting the shots to see when all 12 of them were shot so I would know we were both safe. Finally they all got done. We were very happy that neither one of us had killed or hurt the other one. I had nicked the other man on the back of his hand, but it wasn't anything. That was the end of that little episode. As far as I can remember, it was the end of the dream except that I kept remembering all through it how long it took my husband to go back and get the car.

         "Interpret this dream: My husband and I were up in the mountains, and we were going to walk to this little town. We didn't know exactly how far it was. It was about 3 to 7 miles away. My husband's mother was in the mountains with us, but we were taking my daughter with us on the walk. The road that we were to take was the same one that I walked down in a dream some time ago, not very long ago, but it didn't start at the same place it was supposed to. In this dream I remembered having walked down it before. But I thought I would walk down it with my sister. So my husband and I started out down the road and I pointed out several places to him that I remembered as I walked along. It was a dirt road and winding and it had recently been widened. Sometimes we let our daughter walk and sometimes we carried her. We came to a place where several new houses were being built on either side of the road, very far from any town or anything these houses were being built. It was a Sunday afternoon and yet these people, the people who owned them or the people who were working on them, were out working on the houses. Now that I think about it, even though these things were going on, it was very, very quiet. There was no sound and all these people were just working and not paying any attention to us as we walked by. But we came to this place where these people were building apparently something right in the middle of the road. There was a high heap of gravel in the road, and this man and woman were standing on top of it, raking it, the mound, and smoothing it. Then down in front of it there was a very flat place that had sort of been cleared out, a rectangular form that probably extended under this mound of gravel itself. I was standing in this rectangular space looking at what they were doing or just sort of standing there wondering what the purpose would be. The heap of gravel was up almost to the top of my head, I guess. And finally the woman noticed me standing there and she came up very indignantly and asked me what I was doing there, standing on their fine whatever they were building. I told her I was sorry and I moved, but I thought the mounds were what they were building and not this other place. So my husband and I with my daughter walked around and these people were hosing this mound down. My daughter saw it and started wanting a drink of water. Then the workman at one of the other houses said we had better not give her any because the purity of the water around here was uncertain. So we got on back down the road, and there was some water from the houses going down the street. It was almost sort of a paved street. It was very wide going through a residential area. It seemed to be a regular sort of suburban area, although the streets were quite wider than you would expect. There were no cars around, no people except for a few children.

         "I had been a subject in a dream study and had just finished a prolonged series of continual awakenings. I had gone into this apartment where there were two other men, one of whom seemed like Eddie Collins, and I was starting to describe what we had been doing with the dreams that night. There had also been another dream subject, but it seemed as if he had only been involved for part of the night, and had not spent anywhere near as long a time as I had. I was telling him about the ESP aspects and he looked at me with a deep frown and a when are you finally going to get over that stuff sort of irritation look. I was describing to him some of the dream material, but I can't recall what it was I was detailing to him. Then the other dream subject started to get cleaned up, and I was going to also, but then I realized I didn't have my clothes in the apartment and would have to go back to the school, which seemed to be like the elementary school I attended now, to get dressed. I looked at the clock and noticed that it was about eight minutes after 12 and started to become very panicky because I knew I would have to leave right then almost to make my 12:30 class. There was some kidding about a particular girl, and we kept using her name. I don't remember exactly what it was, but I was saying I was interested in her and was it okay if I started to pursue her. Eddie and one of the others was discouraging me from this and I was saying something about couldn't you stand the competition, that if she were really fatally and desperately attracted to me, why should she be denied this opportunity. It seemed as if I was walking at this point along a short section of crowded street, and for some reason bent over and noticed this woman's legs. They were very fat aned vericosed veined, and I thought she isn't too bad looking as seen from above, but if one looked closely at her legs, these very ugly varicose veins were apparent and the flesh looked sort of segmented. Then I rounded a corner. It now seemed as if I were in a car. I stopped it sort of in the middle of the street near what appeared to be this elementary school I attended in order to get out and hurry and take a shower and get cleaned up for class. After I started away from the car, I looked back and realized I could never leave it in that place, so I had to back it up into what I think was a fire station, come out again, and then park it in a regular parking spot by the school, and as I went into the school, there was a red-haired boy standing near the top of a truck, and then the truck was a series of barbell plates and steel bars that were all connected together. Down on the floor were several dozen barbell plates and some more of these joined bars forming separate squares. As I walked by, the red-haired boy who seemed to have just graduated from high school yelled something to me that he and a couple of others were going out to the West Coast. So I waved to him. I said, \"Good luck, Red. I hope that you like it there on the West Coast.\" But then I noticed that he was coming over toward me to shake hands. As we shook hands, I repeated what I had said before with a little bit extra. Then I walked into this large shop area and people were all busy scurrying about doing work. I saw Eric Shopler, a boy I knew in high school. He looked very serious and preoccupied with this job that he was doing. I yelled some kidding remark to him, but he never replied at all. I went over to my workbench, which was located over in the far corner of this room and was thinking that I had to get my bicycle together because somehow I knew it was in all separate parts, that I had disassembled it earlier. I reached up and took off of the bench a handkerchief which was wrapped up, and inside the handkerchief were several of the nuts and bolts that would hold the wheels and handlebars on. Over the loudspeaker came Danny Kaye and he was singing some song which was excerpted from a movie. In the movie the song was played when a 16-year-old son lost his father, and this was the background music at the time. Danny Kaye was now saying, \"Then now isn't this a beautiful song, folks? Listen to it and see if it doesn't express a beautiful sentiment.\" Then the words to the song appeared and they were something about how I'll never see you again. This moment has passed and our contact can never be returned. I thought the incident involved a rather deep or profound thing when somebody had just lost a loved one, and yet it seemed as if this were being treated in some sort of popularized or vulgar fashion in the song. I was really beginning to get anxious about the time now and tried to hurry out of the shop to where I knew the bicycle parts to be. As I was leaving, there was a moment that was very strong in which I experienced separation; I don't know from whom or what, but very intensely for a second or so. I felt alone. I began to feel rather nostalgic when I realized that Red and a couple of the other recent high school graduates who were in the shop were leaving, and I thought this was always a bad time for me when graduation occurs and friends move on to new spots. Then it seemed as if I were out walking with Calvin, and I still had not got to the shower as yet. We were walking along and he put his arm around my shoulder, which made me uncomfortable, and after a few steps I sort of slid away from under his arm as unobtrusively as I could. He mentioned something about meeting and the person was named in Mexico to get the EEG machine. I was asking I'm still not clear about this Calvin. Is one of us supposed to go down to Mexico to get the machine or is it going to just be sent up from there? Then I was either wet or had been perspiring, but my hand was wet, so I reached down to rub it in some sand which was nearby. At that point a Japanese appeared who was very short and stocky and completely bald, and Calvin wanted to introduce me to him. It seemed this person was somebody we had been discussing earlier and Calvin was scheduled to talk to that afternoon. The person reached out his hand and I noticed that his hand seemed to be rather narrow, and I apologized to him, saying that my hand was very sandy because I had just dipped it in sand. But he said that was perfectly alright. I was also surprised by his handgrip because Calvin had said this person was a weightlifter and he obviously looked very powerfully built. In fact, somehow or another, we seemed to know that he had just come from the gym. But it was a very weak handgrip that he displayed. Then the Japanese said something about had we contacted Gather yet, and it seemed as if Gather was supposed to be the first name of the person from Mexico, but his last name was not Pratt as might be suspected from the first name. I believe I left and Calvin and this Japanese fellow continued in the opposite direction. There was some other one fragment about one time I was driving a very large truck and was coming up to turn this corner which was awkward because it was like a tractor trailer type because there was another tractor trailer pulling out from this street that I wished to turn into. Finally the other truck turned off away from the direction. That is, if the street were east, this truck came out and went to the north. I was waiting on the south side of this to turn into the street. I did manage to turn the truck in by swinging it very wide around the corner right after the other truck left. I was a little anxious that maybe if a policeman saw the poor way I was driving the truck, he might say something to me about it.",

         "I'm at a place that resembles the yoga studio. This is a house, fairly big, and long - with various doors down the side. I'm with some other people and Fred, who's got to feed the pets for the owners of the house, they're on vacation, and he's gone on in. It's rather dark, like a very dark day, or dusk, but that's normal. The house may be old or not, but it's kind of clumsy-looking, not exactly ramshackle but tired, neglected, something like that, and that's normal too. Some men show up looking for the residents, or at least the wife, and we tell them they're not there. They ask [something we can't answer; either where they've gone or can they - the men - come into the house for some reason] and we (or at least I) say we can ask Fred about it, he's the only one who knows anything. So we go down to the door where the kitchen is. I thought it was one in particular and then realized it was the next one instead, so I open that one and here's Fred, behind the refrigerator door, which opens across the space of the outside door. It's also up a step, so all I see of Fred is the top of his head. I start to ask him our question, but he waves me away with his arm - I start again, \"But...\", and he does it again, very vehemently, so I just shrug and say okay, and close the door. I assume that maybe the dogs are very touchy and might get vicious if there's some interruption, or something's going on in there that he shouldn't be distracted from. The door is metal, and rather flimsy - it doesn't close very well and I fiddle with it for a bit. [Next scene: this is directly connected, but I'm pretty sure doesn't happen in the same place.] There's this girl who's staying in this apartment that's part of high-rise combination office/residential/shopping conglomeration. She's young, blonde, short hair, nice-looking - I don't know if she lives here or is staying with a friend, but she's alone for now. She goes down the hall to this copy office, a kind of self-serve place that also has files in it, and a couple of secretarial types who work at desks. Our girl is looking for a file in some sort of drawer - the files are left of the door, and there's a table in the center of this end of the room, so to look in the lower files you're rather crowded between it and the table. One of the \"secretaries\" comes over to the same area and in order to get where she wants, she has to reach around the girl. This is pretty close in, and the girl is very uncomfortable. She gets up as soon as she can. Back in the apartment, some men come in. They're all wearing suits and seem a bit on the tough side, and apparently this is some sort of a kidnapping. The leader forces the girl to tie up the other guys (they're part of the gang, but still this the plan) and then he ties her up, and then himself. Now, you can't actually tie yourself up too well of course, and this is rather perfunctory, but then he can still do the next thing which is to set the place on fire. Actually there is a fire, but the whole place doesn't burn up - there's a lot of smoke and it's very murky but the fire goes out. It appears this is intentional, it's something akin to a suicide pact, but more into S & M. Later [presumably the previous episode is past] she's come back to the copy room again, but this time she's nervous, looking very uptight about something. She stands for a bit on the other side of the table as if she were waiting for something. Then she goes to the file again, and the same thing happens - the secretary comes over and practically has her arms around our girl to get at some files. This time she freaks out, though, and fights back, struggling, kicking, screaming. The secretary tries to subdue her, which makes it worse, and they knock around some more, and then the girl gets away. She runs down the hall, which is where I see her. I start to chase her - there's a reason for this, I'm some sort of law enforcement - and she gets away down the turns. She's frantic - pretty mussed, and her knees are all scratched up, pantyhose (or whatever she's wearing) all torn, she's bleeding a bit, so she's quite noticeable. We've come out into this very large mall, multilevel, lots of people about, bright lights. She runs to an escalator in the middle, and takes off down it. We (someone is with me) follow, and I hesitate for a second at the top, seeing that there's not many people up here but it's crowded at the bottom - the escalator is very wide - and I'm afraid I'm not sure-footed enough to run down this thing. But, I think, I've got on good running shoes and I can do this. So off we go, at top speed, taking 2 or 3 steps at a time, and down toward the bottom. I realize that it's not as crowded as it had looked from the top, there's enough room. We dash on across the floor after her, to a door that leads to the underground parking garage. It's a garage, all right, there's cars here, but boy is it grungy. We're up a bit, you go down a half-flight of concrete steps to the parking floor. Everything here is covered with grime, and to our left a car is being picked up by a filthy tow truck - it looks like they've been working on it, and have had to give up, so they're towing it. The mechanics are all black, dressed in sweaty, greasy dark-blue short-sleeved mechanic shirts and pants. All their stuff has pounds of that thick black grease mixed with dirt on it that you could scrape off like mud. (This is all normal too - in this world, there are thousands of mechanics, they're like the central figures in society, rather the way doctors, lawyers, or policemen or politicians are here - one defers to them, and there are always mechanics working on broken-down cars everywhere you go.) We dash down the stairs, following the girl around the center rows of cars, to the left, then right again to the back wall, where there's a concrete walk up some steps, with a rail, and it turns around to more steps descending into a pit. There's a door down there, and she's making for that - I gather that this is the passage to the \"gang's\" secret hideout, how they've been getting to places they break into. The girl pauses on the steps, looks up at us still on the walkway, and she's wilder than ever. She's got dark circles around her eyes like a 30's Dracula movie, and a maniacal grin. She flings some taunt at us, like, \"We'll be back - we'll get you\" or \"You'll get yours, you'll see\", something like that.",

         "Interpret this dream: I'm at a place that resembles the yoga studio. This is a house, fairly big, and long - with various doors down the side. I'm with some other people and Fred, who's got to feed the pets for the owners of the house, they're on vacation, and he's gone on in. It's rather dark, like a very dark day, or dusk, but that's normal. The house may be old or not, but it's kind of clumsy-looking, not exactly ramshackle but tired, neglected, something like that, and that's normal too. Some men show up looking for the residents, or at least the wife, and we tell them they're not there. They ask [something we can't answer; either where they've gone or can they - the men - come into the house for some reason] and we (or at least I) say we can ask Fred about it, he's the only one who knows anything. So we go down to the door where the kitchen is. I thought it was one in particular and then realized it was the next one instead, so I open that one and here's Fred, behind the refrigerator door, which opens across the space of the outside door.

         "I had been on the phone with Doctor Pf's office. He had gotten a call from a patient who was insisting he do surgery and Doctor Pf said he wasn't a surgeon and he didn't agree with the decision to have the surgery anyway. But he said if he was going to do the surgery he had to have someone assisting him. The surgery was going to be on a little boy and the mother was being very adamant because without surgery the child could die. So I had called Doctor C to see if he would do it. It was 4:30 am when I called and he was very pleasant to talk to for that time of morning and for receiving a call at home. He said no problem. He found out from me who the patient was and where to go and then said he would be there. Later I drove to his house and I was going to spend the night there, but it was later that morning. I got there just as he was getting ready to leave. We chatted very briefly and then he kissed me on the lips and left. I was quite surprised by that, that he did that. I stayed at the house while he left to go do this surgery. I heard Sara C coming so I grabbed a blanket and lay down on the floor behind the sofa and pretended to be asleep. The sofa didn't sit next to a wall. She knelt on the sofa and looked over and saw me lying there. She said something to me and I pretended to be half-asleep. I said I was laying here reading and I fell asleep so I just stayed here. She insisted that I get up and lay on the sofa. She was on her way out. I watched her leave and was thinking that Sara C just didn't seem like the type of woman Doctor C would be married to. They appeared to be an odd couple. Although, Sara C in the dream did not look at all like Sara C in waking life. After Sara C left the boys came down, they were maybe 5-7 years younger than in waking life. It was Jeff C and Ben C although Ben C said that was not his name. I don't remember now what he said it was. It was about time for me to get up already and I had just gotten to sleep. The boys stayed there and wanted to talk and play. So I did. I talked to them and gave them a lot of attention. I realized then that I had to get ready and get to work. I had seen a shower on wheels at the bottom of the driveway. I went out and pushed it to the top of the driveway and it rolled off the edge of the driveway and into the grass. I thought that was probably too far so I pulled it back out of the grass. I was trying to figure out a way to use it so no one would see me naked. It looked like a bathtub with two walls on the ends but nothing on either side. The walls on the ends were not very wide and got narrower towards the top. I realized if I turned it one way the neighbors would see me and if I turned it the other way the cars driving by would see me. I realized that I didn't bring my shampoo and stuff with me so I was going to go back in the house to get it. At that point I saw the shower wasn't even in Doctor C's driveway but in someone else's. So I walked back into the house and I asked someone which shower I should use. They said they didn't have a shower in the house. They said there was supposed to be one in one room but Doctor C made it into his poolroom and so there wasn't one in there I could use. I really wanted to take a shower and get cleaned up before I went to work. I asked someone if I could see the house. There were quite a few people around and they weren't sure if they should let me see the house. I said I was sure it was okay because I worked for Doctor C and he and I had a very good relationship and he had invited me to see the house previously and I hadn't been able to make it. They finally agreed. This house was just incredible. Much of it had an almost sci-fi appearance to it. Contemporary! Cool! Unusual! Yet some rooms were fairly traditional. There is no way I can come close to describing this accurately. The office was fairly traditional. Very large room with lots of dark wood. Very masculine in appearance. Then we started to go into this other room. It was as if the walls had different levels to them, almost like upside down stair steps. But they kept moving. As you tried to enter an area the wall would come down and block you. I tried to get down and crawl under but didn't make it that way either. Someone said you had to push a button to stop them so you could get in. This was Doctor C's own private room and he did that so that other people couldn't get in. I finally found one of the buttons and pushed it and then saw a red door. So I held the button while I got as close to the door as I could and then made a dash for the door. I got through. I don't even remember now what was in this room. We were going from one room to another and we had to get in this monorail type of transport. The house looked like it was a city block in size and it seemed to be located in an area similar to Las Vegas. A lot of neon lights. As we were riding we were outdoors and I could see his house was hidden by lots of trees and greenery. We were going up to the 7th floor and there was a section of wall that was octagon shaped. On each section of the octagon was an elevator door and the octagon was going around in a circle. So you had to try to push the button while it was going around. I finally did. Several of the other people got in the elevator and I couldn't get in quick enough, so myself and another person got in another one that opened. Someone said room 7 to get the elevator to take us where we wanted to go instead of pushing a button on the inside. The elevator itself was shaped kind of like a space module that astronauts return to earth in. And it didn't go up and down but it went sideways and at angles. At another point we were in, maybe his playroom. He was there and not dressed at all like he would normally dress. He kissed me again and this time it was more passionate. He started to pull my blouse up and I stopped him and said no we can't do that. Things still progressed a bit. We did end up making love. Then all of a sudden I wasn't with him again and we were looking at some other rooms in the house. The ninth floor I believe. There was a big open area of marble floor and marble steps, green I think. It was a huge area and I thought this is just such a huge house. The steps here were a half circle, very wide, and fairly tall. I thought, no wonder it takes him so long to answer the door or to go from one room to another. I remember going up the steps but I don't remember where they led. There was another place in the house similar to that. I was spending time with his boys and we were playing and laughing and having a good time. They were really enjoying being with me and the attention. It was time for me to go and I wanted to hurry and leave before Doctor C saw me. So the boys were trying to help me get my things together and out to the car. As I was almost at the car, Doctor C came out.",

It was metered visitor parking. I was wearing my black suit with the knee length jacket. I grabbed some change and put it in my pocket, because I saw the time had expired on the meter. So I would definitely need to put money in. I realized that I had forgotten to bring my coat so I didn't have my portfolio, umbrella, or calendar. I thought I had 80, very small note pad and pen in my handbag. So I thought maybe I would just a home. I was debating whether to take my handbag in with me or to just put the little note pad and pen in my coat pocket. I got out and went around to the passenger side of the car. It was raining and I was going to put my raincoat on. As I was putting my coat on, I saw a penny lying on the ground. I picked it up and put it in my pocket, and I saw another one and another and another and another. They were scattered around, primarily around this one parking space. I think there probably ended up being about 12 of them. I was standing in the parking space watching myself park the car in a space in front of me. I was pulling up and backing up to try to get centered into the space. I saw a penny and then saw myself move the car right on top of it. I was aggravated because I thought I wasn't going to be able to get it now. Then the me driving the car moved the car again so the me that was watching ran up and grabbed it. After I finished picking up all of the pennies I found, I reached into my suit coat pocket to collect change for the parking meter. I was having trouble though, because the pockets were really low on the jacket and I was trying to reach into the bottom of the pocket. My arms were too short. I put one coin in the meter and I was surprised by how little time it gave me. So I put another one in and saw it still had not given me very much time so I put the next one in. There was a little slot at the bottom of the meter like a change slot and money came back out, which is very odd. I pulled out the coins that came back out and put them back in again. I ended up putting in several coins before I thought I had enough time on the meter. I put in enough to give myself 40 minutes. I thought that should be plenty of time, since it was only supposed to be a 15-minute informational interview. I was running very close on time right now, because I had taken the time to pick up all those pennies. I got inside the building and it was packed with people. You could hardly walk. Because I didn't bring my calendar with me I couldn't look for the name or room number of the person I was to meet with and couldn't remember it. I heard someone standing outside the elevator asks someone else inside the elevator for directions to a specific office. As soon as I heard the answer I remembered that was the name of the office I was looking for. I rushed over to the elevator and put my hand in between the doors to keep it open long enough for me to go in. Oddly, the person inside the elevator who had answered the question was actually sitting behind a desk in the elevator. I think the office was on the fourth floor. I walked into the office. There was a heavyset woman, maybe my age, sitting at a very large round table kind of like a conference table. She was busy, but she was having a conversation with someone who was inside one of the offices to my right and slightly in front of me. There was an office with the door open and there was a man sitting in there with his back to me working at a computer. It wasn't actually his office. He had gone in there to work on something. I don't know how I know that, though. I told the woman at the table that I have a four o'clock appointment with Mr. Casco. I realized at that point I was close to 10 minutes late. I didn't apologize for that as I normally would, but she could tell by the look on my face that I felt very bad for being late. I think she told me that he was on the phone. Another woman walked out of her office. She was a very tall, heavyset, white woman was somewhat long dark hair. Her hair was not quite to her shoulders, full and kind of wavy. I would guess her to be about my age or older. She was talking to the woman at the table, saying something about the advantage of being married. She was also saying something about her husband having special advantages because he's black and two other things, but I don't remember now what those were. One of them told me that Doctor Casco was on the phone. Now I'm not sure if it was Mr. or Dr. I'm sitting in that same area talking on a phone to Doctor Casco. Instead of bringing me into his office, he decided to talk to me by phone. One of the first things he said was, \"well one of the first things I have to ask you is why there are no findings on here.\" He was referring to my CV and the fact that there were no results or findings from any of my research work. I said, \"Yes that's true. Unfortunately, there weren't any. The research institute was only open for about 18 months. There were three doctors, partners, who had decided to fund and open the research institute. My experience was that they seldom agreed on the topics of research. One seemed mostly interested in making money regardless of the topic. Another seemed more interested in getting published than the topic, and the third seemed indifferent to the whole thing. There was a medical equipment research representative who was there to talk to us about a study that they were going to be doing and to interview us as a possible center to participate in their study. The doctor primarily interested in getting published told this person that was his primary interest. When asked what our goal was the first thing this doctor said was, \"well of course to get published.\" I couldn't believe he responded that way. Why would they want to consider us if that is our primary concern? I think most people doing research would like to get published, but is that really a primary goal for many researchers. I certainly hope not. What does that say about your character? I would like to believe that most researchers are doing it because they hope to really accomplish something with the research and they enjoy the actual research. I didn't tell him all of that. However, I did say that after about a year they weren't happy with how it was going financially so they decided to close the institute. He said that was a shame. I agreed with him. He asked why they would do that. I said their inability to agree on what kind of research to pursue made it very difficult to pursue grants or participation in other studies - or to follow through when we did begin such a pursuit. He said that was unfortunate, but then he said he guessed he could see how that might happen. It seems that he might have put me on hold again, because I was sitting there realizing that I have another appointment and if I didn't leave very soon I was going to be late for that appointment. I was trying to decide what would be worse, to end this conversation now and get to that appointment on time, or to continue with this conversation and be late for that appointment. For some reason I didn't think I would be able to call the other people to let them know that I was going to be running late. It seemed that it would be rude for me to tell this one that I had to leave to get to another appointment on time when I was late for this one. However, I couldn't try to call the next appointment because I didn't have my appointment book with me and that's where the phone number was.",

         "I decided to go for a bike ride and take a route that I had not ridden in awhile. I was going to return by taking a long country road that ended directly in front of my home. If I kept riding in the same direction as the road I would ride directly into my driveway. This is not all like my waking life home. As I was riding various country roads toward my home I would come to intersections. The first couple of times I slowed way down, almost stopping, before turning onto another road. At the final intersection, however, I didn't slow down at all. I decided I could maintain my speed and navigate the turns without incident. The first was a 90 degree right turn and then less than a undred a feet further ahead was a 90 degree left turn. I navigated both successfully without toppling my bicycle. The left turn put me on the long straight road that led to my house. As I road I came to a large mansion of a home that was being built. I thought about the fact that I had stopped there some months before and talked to the woman owner about a job as property manager. I would guess the woman owner to be somewhere around seventy years of age, with lovely, silver-grey hair. I decided to stop and see if she was there and follow up with her. The structure was not yet completely enclosed so I just walked in through an opening. I saw several construction workers and asked one if the owner was there. I had barely gotten the question out when she walked up. I reintroduced myself and told her I was there to follow up with her regarding our previous conversation. She didn't seem to remember me, but was willing to talk with me again because she was still looking for a property manager to help her finish the project and then perform various functions once the building was completed. There was another younger woman there as well. She had blonde hair and was thirty or forty years old. She was not there the last time and did most of the talking this time. In building this project, they had moved some important items from another property. One item was a very large, beautiful, ornate driveway arch that was made of cement. It was a very pale salmon color and looked very regal. They had also relocated an old cemetery that had contained six or so gravesites. When they relocated it they had not reburied the coffins, all of which looked like the 6 sided pine boxes that were once used for burials. Each looked very weathered and had a cross on top. They were a hundred or more years old and had historical significance. There was something else that they had moved, also of historical significance. They had not done anything with either of these sites because they were waiting to hear what they were required to do, both legally and according to historic preservation requirements. Before I went in to find the owner I had looked at both of these sites again. I found them fascinating and thought it would be quite a bit of fun to recreate or restore these two historically significant sites. When I was inside talking to the owner and her younger employee, I mentioned these two sites. The younger woman said they were likely not going to do anything else with them as they recently learned they were not required to do anything. My first thought that this was disrespectful, especially to the people whose remains were in the coffins. They were intending to just leave the coffins sitting above ground. I knew immediately that if I were to get the job I would try to convince the owner to do something with both of these sites that would be both respectful of the individuals buried but also respectful of the historical significance of the two sites. After we finished talking I got back on my bike and continued my ride home. I had not gone very far when I saw someone else was building a new home, but this one was being build right on the road, so the only way to continue down the road was to ride through the home. It was not fully enclosed yet. I apologized as I was riding through, though there was really no alternative other than to ride through the grass. I decided to stop and see if I might be able to get a part-time, temp job with the construction company. I was talking to the project manager as he and two other men were working. One of the men didn't seem very competent and I could tell by the way the other two looked at each other that they were frustrated with him. I reached up and helped with something they were doing that the third man didn't seem able to do. They seemed impressed that I knew what to do and was able to do it. I told them that I'm not afraid of power tools, have some working knowledge of this kind of work, and can handle small tasks like this. The project manager told the other man they should give me a chance so the other man pulled out a sheet of paper and looked at to see when they could use me. He said I could come in at 3:30 and work until twelve. At first I thought he meant 3:30 in the afternoon. Since it was just going to be five hours a day I decided it would be fine. Five hours a day doesn't fit with the twelve o'clock stop time. Then he clarified that he mean come in at 3:30 in the morning and work until 7 in the morning. I started to say that I couldn't do that but then quickly said okay, thinking that the experience would be good and since it was only part-time it would be okay. I asked him about clothing requirements. He told me that I would need to wear dark grey pants, something like Dockers and a dark red golf shirt. I knew this meant that I would need to go shopping that day so I would have the clothes I need to go to work in the morning. I thanked him and got back on my bike to continue my ride home. After riding a short distance I came upon another house being built in the road. A little later there was a spa type business that was partially built in the road and partially on both sides of the road. I didn't understand how it could be that I hadn't seen it there before as I had to take this road to get from my house to another road or street to go anywhere. This spa had been there for some time. It had numerous regular customers, several were there at that time. None of it was fully enclosed, so it was exposed to the elements. The part in the road looked like a very large spa tub. It had lounge chairs sitting all around it and employees checking in with the customers sitting there to see if they wanted or needed anything. All of the customers were wearing thick, white, terry-cloth robes like you would typically see in a spa. Two women got up and walked to a part of the spa that was to the right of the road, talking to each other as they walked. I wondered how expensive their services were and thought it would be nice to be able to come here on occasion. As I continued my ride home there were several other businesses built on the road. It didn't even cross my mind how people get to these places since they are all built in the road and there is no other road leading to any of them. Several times I thought it seemed to be a long ride home. I didn't remember the road being nearly this long. I kept looking off into the distance to reassure myself that I was going in the right direction. It never looked like I was but I knew I had to be because off in the distance looked like nothing but landscape and I knew the other end of the road ended at an intersection with a bunch of buildings around on all four corners of the intersection and branching out in every direction. There were also a number of times when it all felt like I had this exact same experience before. It was similar to when I dream something and realize that I had dreamt it before, though I wasn't thinking about it being a dream at the time.",

It was similar to when I dream something and realize that I had dreamt it before, though I wasn't thinking about it being a dream at the time.\nSymbols: - Driveway: To see or drive up to a driveway in your dream symbolizes an end to your journey. It also represents security and rest. Alternatively, it denotes your path toward achieving inner peace and finding your spirituality.\n - Driving: To dream that you drive off a mountain road suggests that the higher you climb in life, the harder it is to stay at the top. You feel that your advanced position is a precarious one. It takes hard work to remain at the top. You may also feel that you are not able to measure up to the expectations of others.\n - Road: If the road is smooth and bordered by trees or flowers, then it denotes a steady progress and steady climb up the social ladder. If the road is straight and narrow, then it means that your path to success is going as planned.\n - Street Sweeper: To see or drive a street sweeper in your dream means that you need to clear up some things in your life in order to be able to move forward with your life. Excess things are hindering you from your goals.\n - Macadamize: To see, walk or travel on a macadamized road in your dream suggests that you are standing on solid ground. You have laid out a solid groundwork for much success in your life.",

         "The last three nights I've been having pretty dynamic dreams, but I just finished the whole blank tape and I have been reluctant to start another one. And mostly I've been writing them down in my journal, or rather typing them. But I feel like, for some reason or another, I need to go back to speaking on a tape. And I think that is because my writing -- I describe things differently when I write than when I speak. And for journal and for diary that's good because I like my word sense per se, my syntax. I like how I can sit and come up with vivid descriptions of things. But in my dreams some things are very vivid, and I can't describe them in words, and it's easier to describe them verbally than actually writing it down in words. Although sometimes it may be better to write them down in words because I capture more detail that way, like when I wrote about Samantha and Sandra and Derek and I singing on stage and jumping on this trampoline, I just filled that with as many details as I could think of. And I guess I have to try to do that in my ______. And I keep saying one of these days I want to sample all these things and I want to turn them into mp3's and I want to cram tons of them on a single CD so that I don't have all these tapes laying around, and so that I can start using the tapes again to do stuff like this, because every time a thought rips me, I don't want to have to stop what I'm doing or get up in the middle of the night and go turn in my machine and grab a mike and plug it into the mixer and go to c____ and get Pro and doot, do doot, do doot; doot, do doot, do doot. I want to grab my take machine, hit \"record\" and start saying what's on my mind or what I'm thinking before it just totally goes away. So it's better consistent, just voice, it doesn't really matter; it doesn't have that much spectrum to it. So I can use tapes to capture it and then sit around diddling, diddling and diddling and diddling after the fact. [laugh] So here we go. Last night's dream is still the clearest to me because it was the most recent and because it kind of hit my like a ton of bricks in the way. Not that heavy, but it was something that I was thinking about. I dreamt I was back home in Westport and it was like I had been away for a while, like I am, and I was coming home. And they were having a celebration for me, but it was a little pinky celebration. There was like three people there, I think Clark and Marilou and Terri. And they were just talking, there was no real party going on. But somehow Mom was riding the bike and I was sitting on her handlebars in the basket, and she was telling me that she was pregnant, and that she was having a baby. And she said that she didn't want to have to start all over again, but that Dad wanted another child, and he did want to start all over again. And so she had to have this baby because he wanted one. And she said, \"I'm only going to love this baby half as much as I love you.\" And I was so sad for her because, first of all, she didn't want to start all over again. This is a time in her life where she's ready to move on and do other things, and apparently it wasn't like the regular pregnancy term. It was this deal where you get pregnant, and four or five days later [laugh] the baby pops out. That was messed up, man. And then we were on -- in the last scene of that dream -- we were on the bed, and I was laying and I was talking to Mom about various things. And she was signaling to me that Dad was on the other side of the bed and not to say anything really outlandish. And I looked over and I saw that he was, but in this dream that was unusual because she was on his side of the bed and he was on her side of the bed. Now his side of the bed is the closest to the short mirror dresser and the stereo receiver in the room, and her bed is closer to the upright dresser and the night stand and the air conditioner thing-a-ma-jiggy. So in my dream they were kind of reversed, and I was just kind of making up small talk. And then I woke up. Now the night before I had a dream that was real, real kind of foggy and bleah and blurry, and literally I was walking around in a blurry world. But the concept and what happened is kind of not clear either. I dreamt that we had come home from some kind of long trip and we needed to do something with Grandpa, and it was dark out. And Dad was in the truck and Mom was in the car, and I was riding with Mom in the car. And Dad was going to go to Home Depot and get one or two things for Grandpa and then go over to his house. And Mom said she was going to go do some grocery shopping and make some copies and this and that and the other, and she said, \"I hope you don't mind me driving around so much.\" And Dad was like, \"No, that shows that you love me and you want to take care of things around the house, and for the house. And I was like, \"Wow,\" they would never say anything like that in real life. They've never been gushy over each other. And so Mom and I really were just going gallivanting, just going to do all this stuff together, and we were in this area that had woods. We stopped the car and for some reason we shut off the engine, but the headlights were still on. And she was guiding me through this banyan tree area, I think there were like several banyan trees. And there was this net, and she led me through, you know, tripping through the roots and everything, and there was a butterfly caught in the net, and it was a big butterfly, about the size of my two hands put together, if each hand was a wing. And it looked like a Monarch, and it touched it, and that helped it get out of the net and it flew off. But I felt good that I was actually able to see a butterfly. And that's all I can really remember about that dream. And the third one that was two nights ago or three nights ago, I dreamt that I was at some kind of beach with Mom and Dad and Terri and a bunch of other people, and we were planning this celebration for me for some reason. I think had either graduated or had some kind of successful milestone and we were going to be in a parade, and we were going to be in a school bus in a parade. And we were organizing like the parade route and this and that and the other, and the bus driver had this really thick Spanish accent. And this lady -- I don't know who she was -- I don't know who she was, but she was very outgoing, she sounded like a cross between Terri and Serena, and she was leading everybody and trying to get them to have fun and party on this bus. And you know how buses have intercom systems sometimes to talk to the passengers? Well, she was, her and another cluster of people were yelling into the mike, saying, \"Party, yahoo!\" and stuff like that. And I'm really surprised that there was no feedback, but in this dream that law of physics was suspended, and it was funny because she aimed it at me and I was sitting like four rows back. And she said, \"Jasmine, say something!\" And I don't remember what I said, but I said something and it was amplified as though I was talking into it. And that's all I can remember about that.",

Two aircraft were visible in the air-one was a large jet, approaching the airport for a landing: the other looked like a dirigible.  The latter was too far away to be distinct, but it really wasn't that far.  The jet appeared to be on a collision course with the dirigible, which was motionless, but it was fairly obvious that this was an optical illusion because they were simply in my line of sight but the dirigible was farther away.  One or the other began descending rapidly -- too rapidly and at too steep an angle, it seemed to me -- toward the airport.  I was aghast, because I was sure it was going to crash and explode before my very eyes.  (Actually there were buildings of some sort blocking my direct view of the runway.)  To my surprise, however, the plane was built at such an angle that although the rear half was at a sharp angle with the ground, the front half was almost parallel to it-sort of like some helicopters are designed.  So it didn't crash.  It was carrying a load of VWs, though, and when the plane emerged to the right of the buildings which had blocked my view of it, the wind had caught the VWs and they were flying in the air and bouncing frighteningly on the runway.

         " - Brother: To dream that you are mad or angry at your brother signifies repressed anger that you are feeling but afraid to express in your waking life.\n - Family: Dreaming that a serial killer is killing off members of your family implies that you are feeling cut off from your family.\n - Cruel: To dream that someone is being cruel to you suggests that you need to develop your inner and outer strengths and become more emotionally strong.\n - Death: To dream about the death of a loved one suggests that you are lacking a certain aspect or quality that the loved one embodies. Ask yourself what makes this person special or what you like about them. It is that very quality that you are lacking in your own relationship or circumstances. Alternatively, the dream indicates that whatever that person represents has no part in your own life anymore. In particular, to dream about the death of your living parents indicates that you are undergoing a significant change in your waking life. Your relationship with your parents has evolved into a new realm. If you dream about the death of a child, then it implies that you need to let go of your immaturity and start being more serious. As your child reaches certain milestones and grows into an adult, dreaming of their death may be symbolic of their own self-discovery, transition and transformation into a new stage of life.\n - Revenge: To dream that you are taking revenge suggests that you are experiencing some emotional imbalance.

         " - Classmates: To see old classmates in your dream indicate that you need to draw on your old associations with your former classmates to gain insight in some current relationship. It represents a past lesson that you have learned and is applicable in some aspect of your waking life now.\n - Daisy: To see daisies in your dream symbolize freshness, beauty, innocence, simplicity, friendliness, and cleanliness.

However, he reached out his hand as if to contratulate me at the same time he reached into his vest pocket, which I have never known him to wear in reality. He pulled out a letter with my name on it. When I read it I found that an international physics and chemistry society had awarded me a scholarship for the coming year if I would in spare time aid by teaching lab work in the physics and chemistry depts. Naturally, I was very astonished but quite eager about the whole affair and accepted it at once. For the rest of the day I received congratulations from all of the science teachers that I have ever had or have known indirectly. The day was wonderful and I realized that this all would aid me tremendously in getting into medical school.\n\n### Symbols:\n- Teacher: To dream that you are a teacher indicates that you are in a position of disseminating your knowledge and wisdom to others. The dream may imply how you are \"teaching someone a lesson\" and giving them a hard time about something. If you are a teacher in real life, then the dream is just a reflection of who you are and is about your work.\n - Formal: To dream that you are attending a formal represents a situation where you need to be on your best behavior. Or perhaps you feel you have been too pretentious.\n - Class: To dream that you forget to attend a class you signed up for indicates your anxieties and fear of failing. You may also be lacking self-confidence in your ability to handle new responsibilities or projects.\n - Professor: To see a professor in your dream symbolizes higher learning and wisdom. You will have prominence in some field.\n - Award: To dream that you receive an award indicates that you feel you deserve some recognition or some acknowledgment of your work. To dream that you do not win an award symbolizes feelings of inadequacy.\n\n### Interpretation:",

One of the boys was my boyfriend (he is really the boyfriend of a friend of mine). I was going with them up to the door, and when we were saying goodbye, I was very surprised that he did not kiss me. When I passed by the living room, I saw it all lit up and there were 6 or 8 people talking.\n\n### Symbols:\n- Ghost: To see the ghost of a dead friend/relative in your dream suggests guilt and regrets concerning the past relationships with that particular person.\n - Ghost: Dreaming that you are being stalked or haunted by a ghost indicates that you are refusing to confront issues from your past which is affecting your present life.\n - Room: Dreaming that you are in a dark room with no doors signify ignorance.

         "I was driving through northern Ireland alone.  I felt a tire go flat just as I was driving through some city (Londonderry?) and had to stop just short of an angry mob, and it made me very nervous.  I wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible, but I didn't have a jack.  I inquired at a small filling station nearby.

The door of the bus remained closed and I started banging on it with my hand for him to open. When he opened the door, he told me I was to take the newer bus. I then was standing around when the driver started talking to me and he recognized my face, but couldn't remember my name. (He then was one of my junior high school teachers.)",

The dreamer is feeling that she is being held back by the system and is taking drastic measures to get control of her destiny. The dreamer is refusing to go along with the system. The dreamer is feeling that her opinions and views are clashing with the majority. The dreamer is feeling that she needs to be more independent and move away from a group setting. The dreamer is feeling that she needs to show more patience and less force. The dreamer is in a learning situation and needs to advance rapidly in life. The dreamer is feeling that she is being recognized for her efforts but is still struggling to remember her name, indicating that she is not fully confident in her abilities. The dreamer is feeling that she is being held back by her past, represented by the junior high school teacher. The dreamer is feeling that she needs to let go of her past and move forward."

         "I was doing a group meeting or lecture in the living room of my birth home. Most of the people in the group were black. I was talking about the power of the subconscious mind and I gave a couple of examples from my own experience. I was really strongly emphasizing that the foundation of it all has to be unconditional faith- that whatever you are wishing for, whatever you are hoping for, whatever you are trying to manifest has to have a strong foundation of faith that it will happen. And I actually used the words you have to have the faith that God loves me, God wants the very best for me, he wants me to be happy, and he will bring this to me. As I was talking, this one lady kept talking to someone else. I asked her a couple of times to please wait until I finished. She would go on. I would ask her again and finally she did stop. Then when I finished I turned to her and I said okay now if you would share. She said, No, I don't want to now. I said, well, that's pretty childish but okay. The people in the group were pretty amazed at the examples I gave them. They left.",
         "On a spiritual note, this dream;To dream that you have malice toward others;Dreaming that someone is being a hypocrite;To dream that you are showing your devotion to your beliefs ;To dream that someone is asking for your permission",
         "The dream is about your spiritual growth and your faith in the universe and God. The fact that the group was mostly black people could symbolize the diversity and inclusiveness of your spiritual journey. The power of the subconscious mind is a reminder that your thoughts and beliefs shape your reality. The lady who kept interrupting you represents someone or something in your waking life that is challenging your faith and your ability to manifest your desires. Your reaction to her shows that you are not letting her negativity affect you and that you are staying true to your beliefs. The fact that the people in the group were amazed by your examples shows that your faith and your spiritual growth are inspiring to others. Overall, the dream is a reminder to stay true to your beliefs and to have faith that the universe will bring you what you desire."

The dreamer is going to run for a political position, which is a significant decision. The dreamer is preparing to vote, which is a symbol of making a choice and taking responsibility for the outcome. The dreamer is looking for a seat to sit, which represents finding a comfortable and secure place to make this decision.\n\nThe dreamer then encounters John Chipka, who offers a bookie. This symbolizes a gamble or risk that the dreamer is taking. The dreamer is then riding over railroad tracks, which represents going against the path that others have laid out for them and doing their own thing. The dreamer sees many tracks, which symbolizes the many choices and paths that are available to them. The dreamer then drives down a dirt road, which represents a more rugged and challenging path.\n\nThe dream does not provide any clear indication of the outcome of the dreamer's decision or the risks they are taking. However, the dream does suggest that the dreamer is making a significant decision and that they are taking a risk in doing so.

It was almost as if I was expecting to be awoken any minute. It's sitting right at the back of my mind what I was dreaming about, but I can't remember it now. I was driving down a highway and apparently I was driving pretty fast and the next thing I knew I was behind a policeman who looks more like a county sheriff. The location I don't know where. I sort of stopped fast and felt sure the policeman was going to stop me. At that time a Jaguar went by fast so the policeman went after him. I almost went off the side of the road because I almost ran into a small island on a turn. There was someone with me, but who it was I don't know. I don't have any idea. The content does not seem real in the sense that it is just not plausible, and I have no idea where it was at.",

         "The dream starts with a person entering the room with a tray of cake, but the dreamer can't remember who it was. This symbolizes a situation in the dreamer's life where they are unsure of the intentions of someone close to them. The dreamer then finds themselves being pulled over by a police officer, indicating that they are feeling guilty about something and are being called into question. The dreamer's fear of being caught leads them to try and evade the situation, represented by the Jaguar that passes by and the police officer going after it instead of the dreamer. The dreamer's inability to remember who was in the car with them suggests that they are unsure of the support they have in this situation and are feeling alone in their guilt. Overall, the dream suggests that the dreamer is feeling guilty about something and is trying to evade the consequences of their actions. They are unsure of the intentions of those around them and are feeling alone in their guilt."

We hug and kiss, and feel very connected with a sweet love. He asks me which things I'll take and I say all of them. I ask him to be tolerant and not laugh. I do take out some of the gem rocks and fossils so the load will be lighter for him and me. I have a blue backpack and a box. I decide to return the big fat book and get a smaller one.

         "The dream is about preparing for a journey, both physically and emotionally. The big fat book about World War I symbolizes the heavy burden of knowledge and information that one must carry in order to understand the complexities of the world and one's place in it. The dreamer's decision to exchange the big book for a smaller one represents the need to simplify and focus on the essential information, rather than being overwhelmed by the vast amount of knowledge.\n\nThe dreamer's decision to go west instead of east symbolizes the need to choose the right path in life, and to avoid the false or dangerous roads. The dreamer's strong sense of love and connection with Robert Mitchum represents the importance of having a strong support system and a loving partner during difficult times.\n\nThe dreamer's decision to pack only some of their things and leave others behind represents the need to prioritize and focus on what is truly important in life. The blue backpack and box symbolize the dreamer's desire to carry only the essentials and to let go of the unnecessary burdens.\n\nOverall, the dream is about the importance of making the right choices and prioritizing what is truly important in life, rather than being overwhelmed by the vast amount of information and responsibilities.

Mateo, who is doing school work, represents the dreamer's responsibilities and obligations. The presence of a man watching implies that the dreamer feels that others are judging her performance in her role as a caretaker.\n\nThe dreamer then gets up to go to the bathroom, which symbolizes the need to address her instinctual urges and emotions. However, she finds that there are no regular toilets, only short baby potty chairs. This suggests that the dreamer feels that she is not able to express her emotions in a mature and healthy way. She struggles to adapt to this new situation, which may represent a change in her life.\n\nThe dreamer then gathers up Mateo's school work and her things, indicating that she is taking on more responsibilities. She changes clothes, which symbolizes a transformation or new beginning. However, the burden of carrying all of these things suggests that the dreamer feels overwhelmed by her responsibilities.\n\nThe dream may be suggesting that the dreamer needs to find a healthier way to express her emotions and instinctual urges. She may need to seek professional help or find a supportive community to help her navigate this change in her life.

This could represent her need to find the right perspective or understanding in a situation. The missing top of the lamp could symbolize a lack of clarity or guidance.\n\nThe two brown wrappers with 4c red stamps could represent opportunities or ideas that the dreamer has come across. However, one is slightly torn and the other is printed on. This could suggest that one opportunity or idea is more promising than the other.

    "2. Same for the Rouge.\n",

    "| **Perplexity** | Candidate text is unpredictable and diverges from reference distribution | Candidate text is predictable, fluent, and aligned with reference distribution | **Low** | < 20 (for good results) | Low perplexity shows that the candidate text is fluent, consistent, and aligned with the reference. |\n",
    "| **ROUGE** | More overlapping n-grams (e.g., unigrams, bigrams) and higher recall of key phrases | Fewer overlapping n-grams and poor recall of key phrases | **High** | 30–50 (good), 50+ (very good) | High ROUGE suggests greater similarity between the candidate and reference texts. |\n",
    "| **BERTScore** | Strong semantic similarity between the candidate and reference text | Weak semantic similarity between the candidate and reference text | **High** | 0.85–0.98 (good) | Higher BERTScore reflects that the candidate preserves the meaning of the reference text. |\n",
