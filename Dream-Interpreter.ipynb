Now outside, I'm waiting for my aunt to pick me up - she arrives in a little round convertible and we go for a drive, not very far - we cross a little bridge over a creek, then double back and she drops me off at the house again.

I'm on a little round balcony with a few others (I think men), there are lots more people inside. I feel faint and collapse. They see that I'm very sick, and quickly take me to a car to go to the hospital. (I don't see any of that, the next I know is that I'm lying in the back seat of the car - a sedan - going like gangbusters on a huge freeway. It must be 5 lanes in each direction, lots of cars but not crowded, and all going really fast. I can't see anything else but freeway and blue sky, with a few white clouds. As we barrel along, the road rises, and quickly - soon it changes to steps, which doesn't slow anybody down, and it keeps going up, the incline increasing. Now my line of sight changes to a spot at the side of the freeway (outside of the car), looking across it - and the incline (without the steps) takes a sharp turn up to vertical. The cars are not stopping or even slowing down, and they whoosh straight up. They make it about halfway up on momentum, and then gravity takes over and they fall down. I can see them sort of drop off [rather than sliding down still in contact with the pavement] and fall down way below me.",

         "I watch a plane fly past and shortly realize it was too low. It crashes not half a block away (rather as though it fell from a height of a few yards than flying straight into the ground). and I think there might be survivors, and that I should call the police. Before I get the number dialed, I realize I want the fire department instead. I get no ring, try again and find the line is dead. Some people (3? - at least one a woman) are coming toward the house and I understand they are responsible for the dead phone and I should be suspicious of them. I try to leave the house - run into a pregnant girl at the back; she seems to be in some sort of a bad way and has maybe started labor. The woman from the plane comes this way, calls the others to come get the pregnant girl, and I pretend to be asleep or dead. They don't buy it, I guess, and we all go inside. I'm not a prisoner, I don't think, so much as being detained for some reason, and I go to my brother's old room. He moved out of it a couple of years ago but there is furniture still there and I haven't looked around in a long time. [This does not seem to be the family home - I felt like it was rented.] There are a couple of chests of drawers that I realize I could have used downstairs long ago, yet I've been looking for acceptable furniture all this time. Also there are blankets (as well as clothes and shoes - women's shoes - but they aren't important), a lot of blankets, and I badly needed those last winter but didn't realize they were here. Also a very nice shoe rack. The woman comes back to say or do something. [I don't know what, and the dream ended about there, I think.]",

         "Me pulling the green leaves and berries off some branches or a bush (not from a live one growing in the ground, but inside the house). A boy of 10 or 12 is impatiently telling me, \"Mother's asleep\" (I think) - as if I'm not supposed to be doing what I'm doing instead of her or without her knowledge or something. This is in an old rambling house with lots of old furniture and interconnected rooms. Lace doilies on little tables, throw rugs, etc. Some of \"us\" (family? friends?) - there's 3 or 4 of us, I think - are outside and there's a dog on the rampage - didn't we think it was a wolf at first? Anyway it turns out to be a black boxer or bulldog or something and it charges the back door. There's some kind of flap or opening in it that I plug up - I don't know what the people outside are doing but they're okay and they come in shortly. Somebody has rather by accident invited somebody like a neighbor to come over for something on the order of borrowing a cup of sugar. Trouble is this person always has a party with him/her. Kind of a group of hangers-on who just hang around talking and drinking tea and you can't ever get them to go away. For some reason I go to the front door. There are 2 of them in the room at the front, in a couple of chairs each with doilies, and little tables next to them with doilies and little lamps, and I think they're men in fairly formal suits and oblivious to anything around them. I sort of look at them in resignation or bemusement. There's a staircase here. (They don't go upstairs, after all they are just visitors, not a mob.) Outside there is a hutch as for rabbits or something, covered, not particularly nice. Next to it are a couple of little open shelters with no amenities. There is a guinea pig in each place. The sun is shining directly on the two outside and it's hot. The one inside is not particularly comfortable but he's okay. The other two are dehydrating and too weak to move. I come and look at them, feeling sad and sympathetic but no anger - I have the idea the person who set this up isn't there. I'm going to take them in and try to save them but I'm not sure I can. I'm not going to just let them die out here. The reason they're here if because they were replaced by the one inside like their usefulness as displays was used up. I want to come back and take away the other one, and get him out of the nasty cage. I'm sad.",

         "I'm in a room that reminds me of (but definitely isn't) the living room of the house on A Street. I am there because I live there or at least it belongs to me and I spend time there, and I am on vacation or something. It's afternoon and I remember how the light looked and my cousin came to see me for a visit, as though to let me in on some news or just for fun. I don't know of anything else that happened, but it did involve him lying around on the floor very much the way I do. Very comfortable and casual and warm - that is, that's the way I was feeling. So there's a Training going on, and the room reminds me a bit of school, like a school auditorium. The light is greenish, daylight, morning. The staff wasn't sitting behind tables but in rows of chairs. It was still early - we were instructed to go up on the stage, and we did, but they weren't quite organized and we were standing there for a while. Very informal and chummy. Later I left for a break and went (home?) somewhere away, not a restaurant, for more time than a dinner break. Pete Townsend was with me and maybe some other people. (He wasn't on the team.) Don't know what was going on there, but when it was time to go back we had an errand to run - stopped at a sort of store on a sort of small-town main street. We were going inside and this guy who was with us burst out at me - I don't know what about - and said he was arresting me and getting a peace bond on me. I was shocked but didn't know what it was about except that he was angry at the effect I was having on the group of people that P.T. was involved with. In any case, he keeps me with him and we may have gone inside and come back out again. The place reminds me rather of a dry-goods store, with rows of waist-high bins, and a counter along the side. On the way out, P.T. takes the guy aside and says something very stern and final-sounding in French. I knew it was French but I don't understand it and that was the reason he was using it, so that I wouldn't be embarrassed or have to hear something I wouldn't want to. The guy said something back in French but shorter. P.T. just looked at him like he was disgusted and all through, and took me outside. We got in the car and were driving back - I was still kind of stunned and found he was talking to me - he was explaining something about the incident, and that he could do without this other guy, who I think had been his friend; but he couldn't do without me. He looked at me and said very firmly, \"I need you\". I was overwhelmed and leaned over to him and he pulled me over for a hug. At some point I was concerned that we weren't going to get back to the Training in time because of stopping for an errand, and I thought there might turn out to be another and another, the way I do it.",

I grouse about it and use the word \"kidnapped\" and they think it rather an affront that I would use the word - hurt their feelings. I'm rather in two minds about trying to escape - I think it's the right thing to do but I'm not sure because I find I don't trust these people not to shoot me (!) or the others not to botch the job. In the end, one of them gives me an opportunity - I kind of think voluntarily - and I run. Somebody chases me, but I keep on running - stop once and look around, decide to keep running just in case. They give up fairly soon. Later I go back, after they've been caught - I don't know if that was my doing or not - and there was some problem with punishing them. I'm real mad because I don't think they're being dealt with harshly enough. My friends try to talk to me, make me see that they aren't such bad guys as I made them out to be, and I won't listen.

It must be 5 lanes in each direction, lots of cars but not crowded, and all going really fast. I can't see anything else but freeway and blue sky, with a few white clouds. As we barrel along, the road rises, and quickly - soon it changes to steps, which doesn't slow anybody down, and it keeps going up, the incline increasing. Now my line of sight changes to a spot at the side of the freeway (outside of the car), looking across it - and the incline (without the steps) takes a sharp turn up to vertical.

Some people (3? - at least one a woman) are coming toward the house and I understand they are responsible for the dead phone and I should be suspicious of them. I try to leave the house - run into a pregnant girl at the back; she seems to be in some sort of a bad way and has maybe started labor.

I'm not a prisoner, I don't think, so much as being detained for some reason, and I go to my brother's old room. He moved out of it a couple of years ago but there is furniture still there and I haven't looked around in a long time. [This does not seem to be the family home - I felt like it was rented.] There are a couple of chests of drawers that I realize I could have used downstairs long ago, yet I've been looking for acceptable furniture all this time. Also there are blankets (as well as clothes and shoes - women's shoes - but they aren't important), a lot of blankets, and I badly needed those last winter but didn't realize they were here.

A boy of 10 or 12 is impatiently telling me, \"Mother's asleep\" (I think) - as if I'm not supposed to be doing what I'm doing instead of her or without her knowledge or something. This is in an old rambling house with lots of old furniture and interconnected rooms. Lace doilies on little tables, throw rugs, etc. Some of \"us\" (family? friends?) - there's 3 or 4 of us, I think - are outside and there's a dog on the rampage - didn't we think it was a wolf at first? Anyway it turns out to be a black boxer or bulldog or something and it charges the back door. There's some kind of flap or opening in it that I plug up - I don't know what the people outside are doing but they're okay and they come in shortly. Somebody has rather by accident invited somebody like a neighbor to come over for something on the order of borrowing a cup of sugar. Trouble is this person always has a party with him/her. Kind of a group of hangers-on who just hang around talking and drinking tea and you can't ever get them to go away. For some reason I go to the front door. There are 2 of them in the room at the front, in a couple of chairs each with doilies, and little tables next to them with doilies and little lamps, and I think they're men in fairly formal suits and oblivious to anything around them. I sort of look at them in resignation or bemusement. There's a staircase here. (They don't go upstairs, after all they are just visitors, not a mob.) Outside there is a hutch as for rabbits or something, covered, not particularly nice. Next to it are a couple of little open shelters with no amenities. There is a guinea pig in each place. The sun is shining directly on the two outside and it's hot. The one inside is not particularly comfortable but he's okay. The other two are dehydrating and too weak to move.

         "I'm in a room that reminds me of (but definitely isn't) the living room of the house on A Street. I am there because I live there or at least it belongs to me and I spend time there, and I am on vacation or something. It's afternoon and I remember how the light looked and my cousin came to see me for a visit, as though to let me in on some news or just for fun. I don't know of anything else that happened, but it did involve him lying around on the floor very much the way I do. Very comfortable and casual and warm - that is, that's the way I was feeling. So there's a Training going on, and the room reminds me a bit of school, like a school auditorium. The light is greenish, daylight, morning. The staff wasn't sitting behind tables but in rows of chairs. It was still early - we were instructed to go up on the stage, and we did, but they weren't quite organized and we were standing there for a while. Very informal and chummy. Later I left for a break and went (home?) somewhere away, not a restaurant, for more time than a dinner break. Pete Townsend was with me and maybe some other people. (He wasn't on the team.) Don't know what was going on there, but when it was time to go back we had an errand to run - stopped at a sort of store on a sort of small-town main street. We were going inside and this guy who was with us burst out at me - I don't know what about - and said he was arresting me and getting a peace bond on me. I was shocked but didn't know what it was about except that he was angry at the effect I was having on the group of people that P.T. was involved with. In any case, he keeps me with him and we may have gone inside and come back out again. The place reminds me rather of a dry-goods store, with rows of waist-high bins, and a counter along the side. On the way out, P.T. takes the guy aside and says something very stern and final-sounding in French. I knew it was French but I don't understand it and that was the reason he was using it, so that I wouldn't be embarrassed or have to hear something I wouldn't want to. The guy said something back in French but shorter. P.T. just looked at him like he was disgusted and all through, and took me outside. We got in the car and were driving back - I was still kind of stunned and found he was talking to me - he was explaining something about the incident, and that he could do without this other guy, who I think had been his friend; but he couldn't do without me. He looked at me and said very firmly, \"I need you\". I was overwhelmed and leaned over to him and he pulled me over for a hug. At some point I was concerned that we weren't going to get back to the Training in time because of stopping for an errand, and I thought there might turn out to be another and another, the way I do it.",

Some people with guns turn up, rather like political terrorists, and they're going to keep us prisoner until something, but I don't know what. I grouse about it and use the word \"kidnapped\" and they think it rather an affront that I would use the word - hurt their feelings. I'm rather in two minds about trying to escape - I think it's the right thing to do but I'm not sure because I find I don't trust these people not to shoot me (!) or the others not to botch the job. In the end, one of them gives me an opportunity - I kind of think voluntarily - and I run. Somebody chases me, but I keep on running - stop once and look around, decide to keep running just in case. They give up fairly soon. Later I go back, after they've been caught - I don't know if that was my doing or not - and there was some problem with punishing them. I'm real mad because I don't think they're being dealt with harshly enough. My friends try to talk to me, make me see that they aren't such bad guys as I made them out to be, and I won't listen.

There are 2 of them in the room at the front, in a couple of chairs each with doilies, and little tables next to them with doilies and little lamps, and I think they're men in fairly formal suits and oblivious to anything around them. I sort of look at them in resignation or bemusement. There's a staircase here. (They don't go upstairs, after all they are just visitors, not a mob.) Outside there is a hutch as for rabbits or something, covered, not particularly nice. Next to it are a couple of little open shelters with no amenities. There is a guinea pig in each place. The sun is shining directly on the two outside and it's hot. The one inside is not particularly comfortable but he's okay. The other two are dehydrating and too weak to move. I come and look at them, feeling sad and sympathetic but no anger - I have the idea the person who set this up isn't there. I'm going to take them in and try to save them but I'm not sure I can. I'm not going to just let them die out here. The reason they're here if because they were replaced by the one inside like their usefulness as displays was used up. I want to come back and take away the other one, and get him out of the nasty cage. I'm sad.",

         "I'm in a room that reminds me of (but definitely isn't) the living room of the house on A Street. I am there because I live there or at least it belongs to me and I spend time there, and I am on vacation or something. It's afternoon and I remember how the light looked and my cousin came to see me for a visit, as though to let me in on some news or just for fun. I don't know of anything else that happened, but it did involve him lying around on the floor very much the way I do. Very comfortable and casual and warm - that is, that's the way I was feeling. So there's a Training going on, and the room reminds me a bit of school, like a school auditorium. The light is greenish, daylight, morning. The staff wasn't sitting behind tables but in rows of chairs. It was still early - we were instructed to go up on the stage, and we did, but they weren't quite organized and we were standing there for a while. Very informal and chummy. Later I left for a break and went (home?) somewhere away, not a restaurant, for more time than a dinner break. Pete Townsend was with me and maybe some other people. (He wasn't on the team.) Don't know what was going on there, but when it was time to go back we had an errand to run - stopped at a sort of store on a sort of small-town main street. We were going inside and this guy who was with us burst out at me - I don't know what about - and said he was arresting me and getting a peace bond on me. I was shocked but didn't know what it was about except that he was angry at the effect I was having on the group of people that P.T. was involved with. In any case, he keeps me with him and we may have gone inside and come back out again. The place reminds me rather of a dry-goods store, with rows of waist-high bins, and a counter along the side. On the way out, P.T. takes the guy aside and says something very stern and final-sounding in French. I knew it was French but I don't understand it and that was the reason he was using it, so that I wouldn't be embarrassed or have to hear something I wouldn't want to. The guy said something back in French but shorter. P.T. just looked at him like he was disgusted and all through, and took me outside. We got in the car and were driving back - I was still kind of stunned and found he was talking to me - he was explaining something about the incident, and that he could do without this other guy, who I think had been his friend; but he couldn't do without me. He looked at me and said very firmly, \"I need you\". I was overwhelmed and leaned over to him and he pulled me over for a hug. At some point I was concerned that we weren't going to get back to the Training in time because of stopping for an errand, and I thought there might turn out to be another and another, the way I do it.",

Don't know what's happening, but there's a group of people involved. At least 3 of us stop at a grocery store on our way somewhere - an outing of some sort, like a picnic or an amusement park. The 3rd person is a woman I don't recognize, but she's friendly and energetic - I think she has a kid - this is her store and she knows what we're looking for. It's the sort of place you don't see much anymore - leftover from the Fifties and Sixties. Funny lighting.

Some people with guns turn up, rather like political terrorists, and they're going to keep us prisoner until something, but I don't know what. I grouse about it and use the word \"kidnapped\" and they think it rather an affront that I would use the word - hurt their feelings. I'm rather in two minds about trying to escape - I think it's the right thing to do but I'm not sure because I find I don't trust these people not to shoot me (!) or the others not to botch the job. In the end, one of them gives me an opportunity - I kind of think voluntarily - and I run. Somebody chases me, but I keep on running - stop once and look around, decide to keep running just in case. They give up fairly soon. Later I go back, after they've been caught - I don't know if that was my doing or not - and there was some problem with punishing them. I'm real mad because I don't think they're being dealt with harshly enough. My friends try to talk to me, make me see that they aren't such bad guys as I made them out to be, and I won't listen. (And they aren't - they didn't hurt anybody, or get nasty. My biggest problem was being so angry at the insult to my freedom, that anyone would think he or she had any right to interfere with it for any reason.)",

I say, \"you don't need that knife\" and he says something like, \"Oh, so I don't need the knife, huh?\" - sneering-like, and feints it at my face. I am very aware there's nothing I can do to help myself and I'm afraid but stand still.

         " - Trick or Treating: To dream that trick or treaters are knocking on your door denotes your desire to share your indulgences with others.\n - Funhouse: To dream that you are in a funhouse indicates that you have overcame your fears to the point where you can now chuckle at it. You need to learn to let loose. Alternatively, the dream may be eluding to your distorted or skewed sense of reality. The distortion is of your own self image.\n - Cottage: To see a cottage in your dream represents comfort peace and serenity. You prefer a quiet life of simplicity. The cottage may also represent an altered sense of reality and thus may be a means of escaping the responsibilities and problems that may be associated with your home.

         "I'm at a family reunion in a large fine house with grounds (or a maybe a rented public building like in a park) - maybe it's granite or something, very imposing. I'm on a little round balcony with a few others (I think men), there are lots more people inside. I feel faint and collapse. They see that I'm very sick, and quickly take me to a car to go to the hospital. (I don't see any of that, the next I know is that I'm lying in the back seat of the car - a sedan - going like gangbusters on a huge freeway. It must be 5 lanes in each direction, lots of cars but not crowded, and all going really fast. I can't see anything else but freeway and blue sky, with a few white clouds. As we barrel along, the road rises, and quickly - soon it changes to steps, which doesn't slow anybody down, and it keeps going up, the incline increasing. Now my line of sight changes to a spot at the side of the freeway (outside of the car), looking across it - and the incline (without the steps) takes a sharp turn up to vertical. The cars are not stopping or even slowing down, and they whoosh straight up. They make it about halfway up on momentum, and then gravity takes over and they fall down. I can see them sort of drop off [rather than sliding down still in contact with the pavement] and fall down way below me.",

         "I watch a plane fly past and shortly realize it was too low. It crashes not half a block away (rather as though it fell from a height of a few yards than flying straight into the ground). and I think there might be survivors, and that I should call the police. Before I get the number dialed, I realize I want the fire department instead. I get no ring, try again and find the line is dead. Some people (3? - at least one a woman) are coming toward the house and I understand they are responsible for the dead phone and I should be suspicious of them. I try to leave the house - run into a pregnant girl at the back; she seems to be in some sort of a bad way and has maybe started labor. The woman from the plane comes this way, calls the others to come get the pregnant girl, and I pretend to be asleep or dead. They don't buy it, I guess, and we all go inside. I'm not a prisoner, I don't think, so much as being detained for some reason, and I go to my brother's old room.

A boy of 10 or 12 is impatiently telling me, \"Mother's asleep\" (I think) - as if I'm not supposed to be doing what I'm doing instead of her or without her knowledge or something. This is in an old rambling house with lots of old furniture and interconnected rooms. Lace doilies on little tables, throw rugs, etc. Some of \"us\" (family? friends?) - there's 3 or 4 of us, I think - are outside and there's a dog on the rampage - didn't we think it was a wolf at first? Anyway it turns out to be a black boxer or bulldog or something and it charges the back door. There's some kind of flap or opening in it that I plug up - I don't know what the people outside are doing but they're okay and they come in shortly. Somebody has rather by accident invited somebody like a neighbor to come over for something on the order of borrowing a cup of sugar. Trouble is this person always has a party with him/her. Kind of a group of hangers-on who just hang around talking and drinking tea and you can't ever get them to go away. For some reason I go to the front door. There are 2 of them in the room at the front, in a couple of chairs each with doilies, and little tables next to them with doilies and little lamps, and I think they're men in fairly formal suits and oblivious to anything around them. I sort of look at them in resignation or bemusement. There's a staircase here. (They don't go upstairs, after all they are just visitors, not a mob.) Outside there is a hutch as for rabbits or something, covered, not particularly nice. Next to it are a couple of little open shelters with no amenities. There is a guinea pig in each place. The sun is shining directly on the two outside and it's hot. The one inside is not particularly comfortable but he's okay. The other two are dehydrating and too weak to move. I come and look at them, feeling sad and sympathetic but no anger - I have the idea the person who set this up isn't there. I'm going to take them in and try to save them but I'm not sure I can. I'm not going to just let them die out here. The reason they're here if because they were replaced by the one inside like their usefulness as displays was used up. I want to come back and take away the other one, and get him out of the nasty cage. I'm sad.",

         "I'm in a room that reminds me of (but definitely isn't) the living room of the house on A Street. I am there because I live there or at least it belongs to me and I spend time there, and I am on vacation or something. It's afternoon and I remember how the light looked and my cousin came to see me for a visit, as though to let me in on some news or just for fun. I don't know of anything else that happened, but it did involve him lying around on the floor very much the way I do. Very comfortable and casual and warm - that is, that's the way I was feeling. So there's a Training going on, and the room reminds me a bit of school, like a school auditorium. The light is greenish, daylight, morning. The staff wasn't sitting behind tables but in rows of chairs. It was still early - we were instructed to go up on the stage, and we did, but they weren't quite organized and we were standing there for a while. Very informal and chummy. Later I left for a break and went (home?) somewhere away, not a restaurant, for more time than a dinner break. Pete Townsend was with me and maybe some other people. (He wasn't on the team.) Don't know what was going on there, but when it was time to go back we had an errand to run - stopped at a sort of store on a sort of small-town main street. We were going inside and this guy who was with us burst out at me - I don't know what about - and said he was arresting me and getting a peace bond on me. I was shocked but didn't know what it was about except that he was angry at the effect I was having on the group of people that P.T. was involved with. In any case, he keeps me with him and we may have gone inside and come back out again. The place reminds me rather of a dry-goods store, with rows of waist-high bins, and a counter along the side. On the way out, P.T. takes the guy aside and says something very stern and final-sounding in French. I knew it was French but I don't understand it and that was the reason he was using it, so that I wouldn't be embarrassed or have to hear something I wouldn't want to. The guy said something back in French but shorter. P.T. just looked at him like he was disgusted and all through, and took me outside. We got in the car and were driving back - I was still kind of stunned and found he was talking to me - he was explaining something about the incident, and that he could do without this other guy, who I think had been his friend; but he couldn't do without me. He looked at me and said very firmly, \"I need you\". I was overwhelmed and leaned over to him and he pulled me over for a hug. At some point I was concerned that we weren't going to get back to the Training in time because of stopping for an errand, and I thought there might turn out to be another and another, the way I do it.",

         "I had bought Grandma F's house to save it from being torn down. Part of me is very excited to be there and part of me is very worried about moving back to the country, especially to St. Joe. I think Matthew and I talk about it a little. He has the same mixed feelings. There is so much baggage attached to living there. The house was refurbished/remodeled before we closed on the sale. I was in the kitchen talking to someone from my family about what a great job Marlene F's family had done refurbishing this house. The house was much, much larger in the dream than in waking life. I see something in the bottom drawer of the stove and take it out and sat it on top to the left of the stove. It was very hot. I sat it on the counter and it was bubbling. Marlene F came in and took potholders and checked something in the oven that she had been cooking. She looked at me kind of funny, and the dish I had removed from the drawer. I then realized that it wasn't a drawer that I took that out of. It was part of the stove, a broiler drawer, and the dish still needed to cook more. I explained to Marlene F what I had thought and why I had taken it out then I put it back in the oven/drawer. I had decided to rent some of the rooms to college students. This was going to practically pay my mortgage for me, even though I wasn't going to charge them that much. One of the people that was going to move in there, however, was Jo V. I was so excited that she was moving in, for a number of reasons. She is such a dear friend. She can help me in areas that is not a strength of mine, and it would simply be good to have at least one other person there that I know. There are a bunch of college students outside, standing in a row. I went out to talk to them briefly and tell them we're not quite ready for them to come in yet. I tell them that we are going to allow them to choose their rooms in the order that they registered and pay. They all began reaching for their payments. One Asian couple was going to share a room. They weren't married. They handed me a credit card. One I tried to process it, it was denied. I felt bad for them but needed to only accept students who could pay. Now I began wondering if I would be able to actually cash any checks these students give me. As I continue talk to the group I watch the Asian couple walk away, very dejected and worried. They don't know what they're going to do now. I later decide that I have an extra room and I go back outside looking for them. I see them walking along the road. I run to catch up to them and ask them what they plan to do now. They said they were going to try to get a ride to someplace where they could get some money. I suggested that they at least stay with me for the evening, no charge. I tell them they can help the cook in the morning with breakfast and dishes. I can tell they are very grateful for this so they walk back with me. As we're walking back I think about my intensives at GC. Everyone had to sign up to help in the kitchen for at least one meal during the week that we were there. I decide that it would be a good idea to make helping out a part of the rental agreement for all of the students. There would be assigned tasks and they could sign up for the tasks or shifts that work best for them and their schedules. I let them come inside but tell them they have to wait a bit to get their rooms. Jo V comes in and sits down her luggage. I take her on a tour of the house. We're admiring the nice wall-colors they choose. The upstairs looks very much like the scene of a dream that I had in October 2001. Only where the alcoves were in that dream were doors to the various rooms in this dream. It was almost like a large open lobby, with the doors of the rooms on three walls and the opening from the staircase on the other. I told Jo V I had dreamed about this space before and now here it is. I'm loving that. We walk around and look at the various rooms. The first room we look at only has a curtain for the door. It is the smallest and the most modestly decorated. I thought Jo V would probably take this one and let the students have the other rooms. The other rooms had doors. I was thinking about the small storage crawl space in Grandma's house that we used to hide in as children. I wondered if they had left that and was trying to remember what room it was in. I also remember that a number of the rooms had one or more smaller rooms, or storage areas, inside the individual room. I was trying to remember which room, or rooms, that was. I realized that I had designated that for my own room. It seems to change, sometimes in the dream it seems to be upstairs and at other times downstairs. When they refurbished the house they made the staircase much wider and made all of the steps from a beautiful knotty pine. Towards the bottom of the staircase it made a sharp left-angle turn for the final few steps. Those steps were each longer than the one before it, creating a kind of fan shape. We're talking about needing to finish up the painting. I called an expert and asked their opinion and they told me I should paint the baseboards and crown molding to match the wall colors but leave the door and window trims white. I had gotten a very small thing of paint, about the size of a matchbox except a tad longer. It was the pinkish-red color that was in one room. I had a small artists brush and I began painting one of the baseboards, toward the top so I could immediately see how well it was going to match the wall color. A little later someone came and asked me about it. I said I had put a little on there to see if when it dried it would be close enough to the wall color. I told them what the expert had said. They didn't seem to think that I was going to work, or not going to look good. I'm not sure which. The area now seems to be one long, very narrow hallway with all of the room doorways to my right. I see that the students have gone ahead and chosen their rooms rather than waiting for me. I see one girl lift a curtain and come out of her room. I look toward the ceiling at the curtain and realize that there is just one long curtain hung across the entire wall to act as a door for every room. That meant they had to lift the curtain from the bottom when going in or out of their rooms and risk disturbing those in the other rooms. I didn't think this was at all satisfactory. The house is attached to the children's museum. The alcoves in the October 01 dream were in the back section of a theater, behind the last row of seats. I see a wall with a somewhat hidden entrance. I decide to take Jo V and show her what is back there, acting like I know what it is when I actually don't. There is a woman in there practicing some type of event or performance with a combination of adults and children. I don't know who they are. The woman turns and looks at me and says, sshhh. I realize who she is, who they are, and what they are doing. [Don't know any of them in waking life.] There is another doorway, leading to yet another area behind this one. Again, I pretend to Jo V that I know what it is and take her back there. I realize this is the back stage area for the children's museum. We shared use of this backstage area. I was unclear as to whether I owned the entire building or just the house portion of it. But this means the scene has changed from being a country home in St. Joe to a city home in the city where I live. I lead Jo V back, quietly walking through the area where the group is practicing. I take her to show her another area. There is an entryway that is split. One way leads to my room and the other leads to a huge sewing area. I know she is going to love having this there. The left and front walls are lined from floor to ceiling with various fabrics. The right one or two shelving units are full of decorative trims. Along the right wall something else is displayed, related to crafts or sewing. In the center of the room is a large workstation. There is a woman there. She introduces herself as the staff seamstress. I immediately thought to myself that I cannot afford to have a full-time seamstress and wondered then if I had other full-time staff. She must have noticed a look on my face because she quickly said that I do not pay her salary. That her salary is paid through the sewing projects she does for my tenants. This was a very large and oddly shaped room. John, a male friend of mine is there. [I don't know him in waking life.] I am saying goodbye to him as he is getting ready to leave. He is headed off to do something in particular. It is political and is somehow related to Russia. He gets on a train and leaves. As I walk through the hallway past the room doors I see that there are a lot of young people in each room. I decide a lot of them must be visiting friends, but see that some of them are preparing to sleep on the floor for the night. I decide we need to have an initial house meeting to discuss rules and such, and then we need to have them on a regular basis. I tell them all we are going to have a house meeting in the morning right after breakfast. Some of them moan and roll their eyes. Others look at me like they don't know what I'm talking about and don't understand why we would need this. I tell them it's to let them know the house rules but also to discuss anything they want to discuss. For example, if one of them have allergies to fragrances we should all know that and try to respect it by refraining from using any kinds of fragrances around them. Or if anyone has something that is a real hot-button for them, we should know about it. We just want to get to know each other and try as best we can to respect each other and each other's preferences. It will help us to live together much more harmoniously. I decide that I'll also talk about signing up for tasks during the house meeting. The next morning I go down expecting to see the kitchen staff fixing breakfast. Instead, I see all of the students fixing their own breakfast. One is fixing peanut butter on toast. She has a special name for it, but I can't recall now what it was. I felt bad that they were having to fix their own breakfast, yet certainly didn't want to do it myself. There was very little room to move between the counters and stove and it was not well lit. There were probably fifty students there. I call attention for the house meeting. I realize that I need to get everyone closer together so I can see everyone and so that everyone can hear. I decide we'll go somewhere else in the house and wave my hand asking them to all follow me. The walls are now very curvy. When I get to where I want to have the meeting there is just a large carpeted area. I think it should be fine to ask them to sit on the floor. There is one obese girl there. I see a friend trying to help her sit on the floor. Before I can change my mind she is sitting so I decide to let it go. Many of the students have stopped further down the hall, around one of the curves and I can't see them. I start and decide I need them all closer together so I call those students to come to where we are. I realize there isn't room for everyone there so I walk further and instruct them to continue following me. We reach an area that looks somewhat like the lobby of a nice hotel or a very nice waiting room in a hospital. There are partial-walls every now and then, all curved. Some have sofas and chairs toward the middle of the room, semi-hidden on both sides by these partial-walls. Some have sofas and chairs along the outside of the walls. There are plants and it is very nicely decorated. I stop there and ask the students to find seats. Some will have to sit on the floor but I'm not concerned about that. I think some of them are still too far away but decide to just make the best of it. I had gone to ask the woman in charge of the children's museum if we could just use the auditorium for our meeting. Even though there was nothing going on she didn't want to allow it. I wondered again if I owned the entire building or just the house part of it. I begin talking. I have to talk loudly so they can all hear me. There is a floor to ceiling sheer-fabric curtain hanging along the wall I'm facing. I realize that the backstage area of the children's museum auditorium is on the other side. At first I don't think much of it because there is nothing going on there. As I talk I walk around the area. I look behind the sheers and see there is some kind of meeting or performance going on in the backstage area. I then tell the students they are going to need to move in closer together so I don't have to talk so loud and bother the people on the other side of the curtain. As I am talking I am also standing on some of the tables so the students have a better chance of seeing and hearing me. I occasionally step from one table to another, without stepping on the floor. The wall behind is made of glass panes and the train track is on the other side. I see a train pulling up. I jump off of the table and begin running along the wall with the train and looking through the glass to see who is in the train. I am hoping John is on it. I've been worried that he would be hurt and not return from his assignment. I see him looking for me from a window of the train. I get to the entrance and greet him with a hug. We chat excitedly for just a few moments, saying how glad we are to see each other and that he is okay. I introduce him to the students and tell them about the assignment he just returned from. When I mentioned Russia, many of the students began getting up and gathering their things. I ask them what they are doing and they say that are leaving. They are not just leaving the meeting; they are leaving the house - for good. They want no part of someone who is connected to this activity with Russia. I can tell many of the students don't know what to do, while others are fine with it. So I begin talking about his assignment and why it is such a good thing for all countries. A few of the students who had begun to leave decided to stay. I watch some of the female students continue to leave. They are wearing very glamorous evening gowns. One is a brown satin and has a train on it that has rows of ruffles on it and is sprinkled with rhinestones. I say something to someone about the inappropriateness of their attire. As we get on with our day, some of the students are bustling about, completing their assigned household tasks. Others are getting together to chat or study. I went and talked to the seamstress about replacing the curtain over their room doors. I told her if nothing else she could make separate curtains for each room, but I would prefer that they each have a door. She said she would talk to maintenance and see if we could do that within our budget. I went to my private living quarters. I am using the bathroom and someone just comes walking in. I don't know if she realized what I was doing. I leaned a bit to my left so I could see her and I told her that this is my private living quarters. She said something about the house map not being very clear about that. This happens one or two more times with 2-3 people coming in together. Now a girl comes in wanting to talk to me. I tell her that is fine. We'll just sit at my desk there to talk. After I've finished with her I went to find the seamstress again to talk to her about the door to my private living quarters. At first the door was a full wood door with a bubbled glass pane in most of the top half of it. On the outside of the door we had something printed on it to designate that it was private quarters. I realized that whatever was on it was not clear enough. Now it seems that the door is just a partial one, more like what you would see on a public bathroom stall with another alongside it. One leads to my private quarters and the other leads to the sewing area. We decide that students are getting confused and coming in the wrong door. But then it seems that there is just one door and the confusion happens when they come through the door and face two hallways. They choose the one to the left that leads to my private quarters instead of the one to the right that leads to the sewing area. Then I suggest that maybe we just need two separate doors. The seamstress is going to once again contact maintenance and have them take care of it. She will also have them change the wording on the door to make sure it is very clear that it is private quarters and they are not to enter. I suppose if I keep it locked at all times it would solve the problem. I'm not sure why this doesn't occur to me then, or why I don't want to do that. My private living quarters have the same curvy walls that were in the other area. Now the location is confusing, as it seems both Grandma F's home and my birth home both. Many of our family members are there. I hear someone shout that Hope and Faith have had their baby. They are relatives. [unknown in waking life.] I run out to the living room and see that the front door is standing open. I go to the door and see a sign, seemingly floating in the air, that announces the birth of the baby. I'm trying to figure out how that sign is out and there and floating like that. Someone points out to me that Daddy has it on a string so it is flying like a kite. The string isn't noticeable at all. I look to my far left and finally spot Daddy. He is running across the front yard because the sign is pulling him along. I'm surprised to see him running that well and it is not bothering him physically at all. It's dark outside. Daddy had been at the hospital with the father. Mother had been there too, but had driven herself because her and Daddy were either divorced or separated. Daddy was still living at our birth home. I don't know where mother was living. I wondered how it was for them to be at the hospital together. There are several cars in the driveway. Mine is one of them. Matthew is there and we are talking about various things. I have to go to work at CAS. I only have a few days left to work there and I don't want to be late and give them the impression that I don't care any longer, or that I'm no longer conscientious about being on time, etc. As I was trying to get ready Matthew kept coming in and asking me questions and talking to me. Most of the time I would have to stop what I was doing, turn my head, and ask him to repeat himself because I either didn't hear or didn't understand what he was saying. He said something to me about his room. I was surprised that he had chosen a room upstairs with all of the college students rather than having the room designated for him downstairs. I'm trying to put my makeup on. I put my mascara on and realize how long it has made my lashes. I look at the tube and see that it is one that I've not used before. I'm very excited that it is working so well. Then I realize they have gotten very clumpy. As I try to fix it I smear it on my cheek. I reapply it and then use my eyelash comb to separate the lashes. After I'm done I decide they look ridiculously long so I decide to try to remove and fix it. As I do the lashes on one eye ends up looking like a sparkling blue and the lashes of the other eye are a sparkling pink. I wonder if I can just go like this - if it's very noticeable. Matthew tries to tell me it's not but I can tell he's lying so I redo it completely. As I'm finally just about ready I realize that I have flight today to the SAID conference and I don't remember what time my flight is. I ask Matthew to go get my ticket for me. He says something, indicating that he doesn't want to and I say, please, in a begging tone. I know it's not going to be easy to describe to him where it is because it is a drawer in one of the small rooms inside my room and I haven't fully settled in at our new home yet. I do my best. The attic has been refurbished to house the student's rooms and that is where my private living quarters are also. He comes back and hasn't found it. Then I realize it is in the safe and tell him where the safe is. I realize I'm going to be an hour late for work. I decide that I'll call Bill C on the way and tell him that I'm running late because of the birth. I'm concerned that my car is blocked in and I'm not going to be able to get out. I found out that Bev was leaving at the same time and that was going to be enough for me to be able to get out. Daddy and someone were emptying things out of the back of my SUV. There were looking at it and talking about it being my new SUV. At that time it looked like a truck, but when I got in to leave it looked like an SUV again. As I got ready to pull out of the driveway I noticed there were cars parked to my left, all along the right side of the road, bumper-to-bumper. It was still just dusk, mostly dark. A car seemed to pull out of our yard from the left side of the road and heading towards me. I noticed it was an older couple. The man was driving and a woman was sitting in the passenger seat drinking a cup of coffee. I looked around to see why all these cars were around. At first I thought maybe one of the neighbors was having a yard sale but decided it was too dark outside, or too early in the morning for that. I went ahead and pulled out of the driveway headed to my left. Just after I did I realized that I had forgotten something and needed to go back to the house. I decided it would be easiest to just park along the road with the other cars and walk back. When I went back I couldn't remember for sure where I parked, or how far away. It seems that I walked two or three blocks. The area looked more like city blocks of an old, small town, than it did like the rural route that our birth home is actually on. Earlier I had been talking with one of my brothers and mentioned a local bar and deli that had closed. They asked me which one. I told them it was a small one on of the corners. It was a little mom and pop business. As I was walking to my SUV, I remembered this conversation and was trying to remember on which of these corners the business used to be. If I could remember then I could tell my brother more precisely where the business had been. As I walked I wasn't even sure I would know my SUV when I saw it, because I hadn't had it very long, it looked so much like so many others, and it was dark outside and little hard to see. As I walk I see about one hundred feet in front me is a large vehicle completely blocking the road. I immediately get upset thinking that this will be yet another delay in my getting to work because I'm not going to be able to get around him at all. I realize that he is moving out of the way. I walk back and forth two or three blocks trying to find my SUV. I see a man with a boat pulled perpendicular to all of the cars parked along the road. It looks like it is against an SUV. At first I think it's mine and I get upset and start looking at the SUV to see if there is any damage. There isn't but then I realize that isn't mine anyway.",

         "Interpret this dream: I had bought Grandma F's house to save it from being torn down. Part of me is very excited to be there and part of me is very worried about moving back to the country, especially to St. Joe. I think Matthew and I talk about it a little. He has the same mixed feelings. There is so much baggage attached to living there. The house was refurbished/remodeled before we closed on the sale. I was in the kitchen talking to someone from my family about what a great job Marlene F's family had done refurbishing this house. The house was much, much larger in the dream than in waking life. I see something in the bottom drawer of the stove and take it out and sat it on top to the left of the stove. It was very hot. I sat it on the counter and it was bubbling. Marlene F came in and took potholders and checked something in the oven that she had been cooking. She looked at me kind of funny, and the dish I had removed from the drawer. I then realized that it wasn't a drawer that I took that out of. It was part of the stove, a broiler drawer, and the dish still needed to cook more. I explained to Marlene F what I had thought and why I had taken it out then I put it back in the oven/drawer. I had decided to rent some of the rooms to college students. This was going to practically pay my mortgage for me, even though I wasn't going to charge them that much. One of the people that was going to move in there, however, was Jo V. I was so excited that she was moving in, for a number of reasons. She is such a dear friend. She can help me in areas that is not a strength of mine, and it would simply be good to have at least one other person there that I know. There are a bunch of college students outside, standing in a row. I went out to talk to them briefly and tell them we're not quite ready for them to come in yet. I tell them that we are going to allow them to choose their rooms in the order that they registered and pay. They all began reaching for their payments. One Asian couple was going to share a room. They weren't married. They handed me a credit card. One I tried to process it, it was denied. I felt bad for them but needed to only accept students who could pay. Now I began wondering if I would be able to actually cash any checks these students give me. As I continue talk to the group I watch the Asian couple walk away, very dejected and worried. They don't know what they're going to do now. I later decide that I have an extra room and I go back outside looking for them. I see them walking along the road. I run to catch up to them and ask them what they plan to do now. They said they were going to try to get a ride to someplace where they could get some money. I suggested that they at least stay with me for the evening, no charge. I tell them they can help the cook in the morning with breakfast and dishes. I can tell they are very grateful for this so they walk back with me. As we're walking back I think about my intensives at GC. Everyone had to sign up to help in the kitchen for at least one meal during the week that we were there. I decide that it would be a good idea to make helping out a part of the rental agreement for all of the students. There would be assigned tasks and they could sign up for the tasks or shifts that work best for them and their schedules. I let them come inside but tell them they have to wait a bit to get their rooms. Jo V comes in and sits down her luggage. I take her on a tour of the house. We're admiring the nice wall-colors they choose. The upstairs looks very much like the scene of a dream that I had in October 2001. Only where the alcoves were in that dream were doors to the various rooms in this dream. It was almost like a large open lobby, with the doors of the rooms on three walls and the opening from the staircase on the other. I told Jo V I had dreamed about this space before and now here it is. I'm loving that. We walk around and look at the various rooms. The first room we look at only has a curtain for the door. It is the smallest and the most modestly decorated. I thought Jo V would probably take this one and let the students have the other rooms. The other rooms had doors. I was thinking about the small storage crawl space in Grandma's house that we used to hide in as children. I wondered if they had left that and was trying to remember what room it was in. I also remember that a number of the rooms had one or more smaller rooms, or storage areas, inside the individual room. I was trying to remember which room, or rooms, that was. I realized that I had designated that for my own room. It seems to change, sometimes in the dream it seems to be upstairs and at other times downstairs. When they refurbished the house they made the staircase much wider and made all of the steps from a beautiful knotty pine. Towards the bottom of the staircase it made a sharp left-angle turn for the final few steps. Those steps were each longer than the one before it, creating a kind of fan shape. We're talking about needing to finish up the painting. I called an expert and asked their opinion and they told me I should paint the baseboards and crown molding to match the wall colors but leave the door and window trims white. I had gotten a very small thing of paint, about the size of a matchbox except a tad longer. It was the pinkish-red color that was in one room. I had a small artists brush and I began painting one of the baseboards, toward the top so I could immediately see how well it was going to match the wall color. A little later someone came and asked me about it. I said I had put a little on there to see if when it dried it would be close enough to the wall color. I told them what the expert had said. They didn't seem to think that I was going to work, or not going to look good. I'm not sure which. The area now seems to be one long, very narrow hallway with all of the room doorways to my right. I see that the students have gone ahead and chosen their rooms rather than waiting for me. I see one girl lift a curtain and come out of her room. I look toward the ceiling at the curtain and realize that there is just one long curtain hung across the entire wall to act as a door for every room. That meant they had to lift the curtain from the bottom when going in or out of their rooms and risk disturbing those in the other rooms. I didn't think this was at all satisfactory. The house is attached to the children's museum. The alcoves in the October 01 dream were in the back section of a theater, behind the last row of seats. I see a wall with a somewhat hidden entrance. I decide to take Jo V and show her what is back there, acting like I know what it is when I actually don't. There is a woman in there practicing some type of event or performance with a combination of adults and children. I don't know who they are. The woman turns and looks at me and says, sshhh. I realize who she is, who they are, and what they are doing. [Don't know any of them in waking life.] There is another doorway, leading to yet another area behind this one. Again, I pretend to Jo V that I know what it is and take her back there. I realize this is the back stage area for the children's museum. We shared use of this backstage area. I was unclear as to whether I owned the entire building or just the house portion of it. But this means the scene has changed from being a country home in St. Joe to a city home in the city where I live. I lead Jo V back, quietly walking through the area where the group is practicing. I take her to show her another area. There is an entryway that is split. One way leads to my room and the other leads to a huge sewing area. I know she is going to love having this there. The left and front walls are lined from floor to ceiling with various fabrics. The right one or two shelving units are full of decorative trims. Along the right wall something else is displayed, related to crafts or sewing. In the center of the room is a large workstation. There is a woman there. She introduces herself as the staff seamstress. I immediately thought to myself that I cannot afford to have a full-time seamstress and wondered then if I had other full-time staff. She must have noticed a look on my face because she quickly said that I do not pay her salary. That her salary is paid through the sewing projects she does for my tenants. This was a very large and oddly shaped room. John, a male friend of mine is there. [I don't know him in waking life.] I am saying goodbye to him as he is getting ready to leave. He is headed off to do something in particular. It is political and is somehow related to Russia. He gets on a train and leaves. As I walk through the hallway past the room doors I see that there are a lot of young people in each room. I decide a lot of them must be visiting friends, but see that some of them are preparing to sleep on the floor for the night. I decide we need to have an initial house meeting to discuss rules and such, and then we need to have them on a regular basis. I tell them all we are going to have a house meeting in the morning right after breakfast. Some of them moan and roll their eyes. Others look at me like they don't know what I'm talking about and don't understand why we would need this. I tell them it's to let them know the house rules but also to discuss anything they want to discuss. For example, if one of them have allergies to fragrances we should all know that and try to respect it by refraining from using any kinds of fragrances around them. Or if anyone has something that is a real hot-button for them, we should know about it. We just want to get to know each other and try as best we can to respect each other and each other's preferences. It will help us to live together much more harmoniously. I decide that I'll also talk about signing up for tasks during the house meeting. The next morning I go down expecting to see the kitchen staff fixing breakfast. Instead, I see all of the students fixing their own breakfast. One is fixing peanut butter on toast. She has a special name for it, but I can't recall now what it was. I felt bad that they were having to fix their own breakfast, yet certainly didn't want to do it myself. There was very little room to move between the counters and stove and it was not well lit. There were probably fifty students there. I call attention for the house meeting. I realize that I need to get everyone closer together so I can see everyone and so that everyone can hear. I decide we'll go somewhere else in the house and wave my hand asking them to all follow me. The walls are now very curvy. When I get to where I want to have the meeting there is just a large carpeted area. I think it should be fine to ask them to sit on the floor. There is one obese girl there. I see a friend trying to help her sit on the floor. Before I can change my mind she is sitting so I decide to let it go. Many of the students have stopped further down the hall, around one of the curves and I can't see them. I start and decide I need them all closer together so I call those students to come to where we are. I realize there isn't room for everyone there so I walk further and instruct them to continue following me. We reach an area that looks somewhat like the lobby of a nice hotel or a very nice waiting room in a hospital. There are partial-walls every now and then, all curved. Some have sofas and chairs toward the middle of the room, semi-hidden on both sides by these partial-walls. Some have sofas and chairs along the outside of the walls. There are plants and it is very nicely decorated. I stop there and ask the students to find seats. Some will have to sit on the floor but I'm not concerned about that. I think some of them are still too far away but decide to just make the best of it. I had gone to ask the woman in charge of the children's museum if we could just use the auditorium for our meeting. Even though there was nothing going on she didn't want to allow it. I wondered again if I owned the entire building or just the house part of it. I begin talking. I have to talk loudly so they can all hear me. There is a floor to ceiling sheer-fabric curtain hanging along the wall I'm facing. I realize that the backstage area of the children's museum auditorium is on the other side. At first I don't think much of it because there is nothing going on there. As I talk I walk around the area. I look behind the sheers and see there is some kind of meeting or performance going on in the backstage area. I then tell the students they are going to need to move in closer together so I don't have to talk so loud and bother the people on the other side of the curtain. As I am talking I am also standing on some of the tables so the students have a better chance of seeing and hearing me. I occasionally step from one table to another, without stepping on the floor. The wall behind is made of glass panes and the train track is on the other side. I see a train pulling up. I jump off of the table and begin running along the wall with the train and looking through the glass to see who is in the train. I am hoping John is on it. I've been worried that he would be hurt and not return from his assignment. I see him looking for me from a window of the train. I get to the entrance and greet him with a hug. We chat excitedly for just a few moments, saying how glad we are to see each other and that he is okay. I introduce him to the students and tell them about the assignment he just returned from. When I mentioned Russia, many of the students began getting up and gathering their things. I ask them what they are doing and they say that are leaving. They are not just leaving the meeting; they are leaving the house - for good. They want no part of someone who is connected to this activity with Russia. I can tell many of the students don't know what to do, while others are fine with it. So I begin talking about his assignment and why it is such a good thing for all countries. A few of the students who had begun to leave decided to stay. I watch some of the female students continue to leave. They are wearing very glamorous evening gowns. One is a brown satin and has a train on it that has rows of ruffles on it and is sprinkled with rhinestones. I say something to someone about the inappropriateness of their attire. As we get on with our day, some of the students are bustling about, completing their assigned household tasks. Others are getting together to chat or study. I went and talked to the seamstress about replacing the curtain over their room doors. I told her if nothing else she could make separate curtains for each room, but I would prefer that they each have a door. She said she would talk to maintenance and see if we could do that within our budget. I went to my private living quarters. I am using the bathroom and someone just comes walking in.

My private living quarters have the same curvy walls that were in the other area. Now the location is confusing, as it seems both Grandma F's home and my birth home both. Many of our family members are there. I hear someone shout that Hope and Faith have had their baby. They are relatives.

I go to the door and see a sign, seemingly floating in the air, that announces the birth of the baby. I'm trying to figure out how that sign is out and there and floating like that. Someone points out to me that Daddy has it on a string so it is flying like a kite. The string isn't noticeable at all. I look to my far left and finally spot Daddy. He is running across the front yard because the sign is pulling him along. I'm surprised to see him running that well and it is not bothering him physically at all. It's dark outside. Daddy had been at the hospital with the father. Mother had been there too, but had driven herself because her and Daddy were either divorced or separated. Daddy was still living at our birth home. I don't know where mother was living. I wondered how it was for them to be at the hospital together. There are several cars in the driveway. Mine is one of them. Matthew is there and we are talking about various things. I have to go to work at CAS. I only have a few days left to work there and I don't want to be late and give them the impression that I don't care any longer, or that I'm no longer conscientious about being on time, etc. As I was trying to get ready Matthew kept coming in and asking me questions and talking to me.

As I'm finally just about ready I realize that I have flight today to the SAID conference and I don't remember what time my flight is. I ask Matthew to go get my ticket for me.

I decided it would be easiest to just park along the road with the other cars and walk back. When I went back I couldn't remember for sure where I parked, or how far away. It seems that I walked two or three blocks. The area looked more like city blocks of an old, small town, than it did like the rural route that our birth home is actually on.

         "I was working for SVH. I had two sons. One was Matthew's current age and one much younger. They were helping me get things ready so I could leave for the day and part of it was reconciling the cash. The boys were arguing about something. I told the older one that he needed to be patient with the younger one, because even the older one was getting impatient with me at that time about wanting to do things differently than I wanted him to. That's what was happening with the little one also. The older one was hassling him, trying to make him do it a certain way. I said to the older one, but you're getting upset with me right now for the very same thing. You don't want me to show you how I want it done or how it needs to be done. You want me to just let you do it your way. When we were in our car, ready to go home, it was just Matthew at his current age and myself. We were driving a pickup truck. He started to back up and I started saying, The gate is down! The gate is down! I had to say it 4-5 times before he stopped. By the time he stopped it was too late. He had hit another vehicle so the gate lifted the other car, moved it over a bit, and pushed it back. In doing so, he hurt two other boys. One was Matthew's current age. The other was the age of the younger Matthew in the dream earlier. The younger one wasn't seriously injured but the older one was fighting for his life, he was unconscious. The doctors and nurses kept telling me that they didn't know if he would pull through or not. I didn't want to leave the hospital because I was so worried about the boy and I was frustrated with Matthew. I felt it happened because of a typical behavior of his, not listening to words of caution, thinking that he already knows best. Until something happens, he tends to have to learn his lessons the hard way. I was frustrated because I didn't want someone to have to lose their life before Matthew would start driving more carefully and about being more open to other people's advice. I was very concerned and upset. I took to the younger boy and asked him if he believed in God. His grandmother was there. One of them said that they did. I was cleaning the equipment around the older boy's bed. Something I did seemed to make a difference. There seemed to be a turn for the better. As I was cleaning I kept praying and praying asking God to please let him pull through. Part of me felt as though I was praying for the boy for the wrong reason. I really wanted him to pull through for himself and for his family, but also for Matthew. I felt really bad about what happened and because Matthew is my son. Even though he is 19, I still feel very responsible for him and the person he is and his behavior. From that respect I felt horrible about what happened. So I was praying for our sake as well. Whatever I did caused a slight improvement. The doctors were still telling us to be very cautious and not get overly optimistic. He said it was a good sign but it did not mean that he was completely out of danger. The little boy said he saw his brother holding out his hand for him and he thought that meant that he was going to be okay. I wanted to say to the boy, you know, if you see him holding out his hand, maybe that means that God is holding out his hand for your brother, and we should take comfort in that. It doesn't matter if God is going to walk him home to heaven or walk him home to you. We should take comfort that God is going to walk with him. But I didn't say it because I wasn't sure if it was an appropriate thing for me to say. Would it be appropriate for me to say as the person I was in the dream and am now? Would it be appropriate for me to say as a spiritual director? Does it make a difference? I knew some of the nurses and other employees because I worked there. We were going to start having monthly movie nights at our department, or center, where we work. We may have just done one. I think it may have been two connected departments and I worked in the other. I was going to be in charge of this with a couple of nurses from the other department. That particular time we had done it in their department. I was walking around, cleaning up, sweeping the floors. There was something about the fact that we shouldn't spend our time doing that. I thought I should be able to do that if I wanted to. It makes things look better and I don't mind sweeping up after someone else. There was a discussion about that room not being very important compared to what we do. Maybe even that didn't support our basic philosophies or values. I'm not sure I understand that. I continued to sweep and clean up. In fact, in the one area where the other nurses were, there were doors open and I was trying to sweep some of the leaves up and outside. The leaves were blowing in and around the room. It didn't seem to bother me. I was aware of it, but it wasn't frustrating me that more leaves kept blowing back in. I thought I would just do the best that I could. I had moved back to my area and was sweeping one of the rooms there. I thought the room I was in would be a nice place to have the monthly movie nights and that I should check with my manager to see if they would mind that. It's a room that we could stretch out; maybe even lay on the floor. I was thinking how comfortable the basic plastic molded chairs in this room would be compared to the student chairs with desktops that were in the other room. Then I thought maybe not. At first I had the impression that it was carpeted but it wasn't. I started to wonder if there was a screen in there that we could show the movie on. I don't think there was and I didn't know what would be involved in getting one in there. I finally decided it would just be best to continue using the room that we had used. Somehow I knew that Br. Barry had been brought in on this conversation about to sweep or not to sweep. It seems that he could see where we were both coming from, and didn't really see the problem if I had the time or even if I wanted to do it on my own time. I realized that no one had been talking to the older boy who had been hurt. I thought maybe I should go tell his younger brother that he should go talk to him. Some people believe that people who are unconscious or in a coma can hear you talk to them or that it does make a difference in their recovery. I thought it might be good for the younger boy as well, to talk to his brother. Then I thought I should tell Matthew that as well. Matthew should go talk to the young man and make his peace with the situation in case the boy didn't make it. I didn't think Matthew had any idea it would be for him if this young man doesn't pull through. I felt it was very important that he go talk to him, to apologize, or whatever else he felt he needed to say. Again, I didn't know if that was appropriate to tell the two of them to go talk to them. I was in training to become a doctor. I was seeing this patient, even though I realized that I had two more years before I would actually be a doctor. I was referring to myself as a doctor to her. It wasn't until later that I realized that was inappropriate and I should clarify to her that I still had two more years of education. Whatever her problem was, I had taken care of it for her. I had gone into this classroom where we were later going to be viewing a movie together. The mother of the woman whom I had treated, or spoken with, was there. She was waiting for her daughter so they could go home. Ben D was in this room. I was excited to see him there. I was debating what I should say to him, should I express my personal interest, was there something that I could say to get him to ask me out. I just tried to be very kind, friendly, and not overly so. I was surprised that he was there. I learned that he had come to attend a lecture and that he does this quite often. So then I thought I should tell him if he is ever in the city where I live that he should give me a call and we could have dinner, similar to what he had said to me in waking life. I went into the room a few times and chatted with him briefly. The mother of this woman that I had treated was there also. I finally realized that Ben D was hanging around to take her to dinner after her daughter was finished there. This disappointed me, that he was there to socialize with this other woman, and he wasn't expressing any additional interest in seeing me socially. I was stewing over this, wondering if there was anything that I could or should do or say. I was contemplating how I was feeling about this experience and what, if anything, I should do. The young man did die. As soon as Matthew heard, he broke down in tears. He was very upset. I had not had the opportunity to suggest that he talk to the young man, even though the young man was in a coma. We were at home and Matthew was in the shower trying to relax. I was going to go rub his back or something to help him relax. I had a method or ritual or something to try to help him relax. aromatherapy, music, etc. It occurred to me that some people might find this inappropriate but since we were both in bathing suits I decided that it was fine. I knew how upset Matthew was and I wanted to help him. but myself as well because I was also very upset by the whole thing. Prior to this, there were approximately 20 workmen outside of my house doing some repairs. They had finished their work. On the kitchen counter there was a 1 _ inch to 2-inch gap between the cabinet and the counter. kind of like a hole. It was probably 12 inches long but it was arched. I thought it was terrible. One of them said there was nothing that could be done. I was going to talk to one of the other workers to verify that or to find someone who could fix it. Then there were even more people there. People that I knew. They wanted to know about this ritual that I use for relaxation. They wanted to witness it. They were waiting for me to prepare everything. Probably 15 of them were waiting outside. It was very hot, so they had removed their shirts. I had gone out for a minute. I jokingly said something about fifteen shirtless men sitting in my front yard and that not happening very often. They all laughed. I had some of the people helping me collect candles. My shower was something like you would see in a health club. It was almost like three shower stalls, divided, but the partition-dividers were clear so you could see through them, and they were long and narrow. Lots of people had gathered in these three shower stalls to watch the ritual. They were all clothed. They didn't seem to be showering, but the water was on. They were sitting in a row, because the stalls were long and narrow and they couldn't stand or sit 2 or 3 people across. I told them that to do the ritual I would need all of the people out of there. They all cleared out and were helping me put the candles in but they were putting them in the wrong places. In the one shower stall that I was going to be using there were quite a few plants on the one end, ivy and hanging plants, etc. I was placing the candles very carefully so they wouldn't light the plants on fire. I had them replace some of the candles because I only wanted candles that were either white or very dark colors such as maroon, green and navy. There was also a man in there filming it. But he was filming it while all the other people were in there. I said, I do believe it may be useful for people to have a video of this ritual because they could see it being performed and learn to use it for themselves or their loved ones. However, I think it should be done right if you are going to do it. He found a blank tape that was a minute or two long. I told him that wasn't really going to do much good. Then he found another one that was much longer. I had two women friends, close to me. I didn't have a place to change into my swimsuit. There were so many people around I couldn't find a private place to change. I thought I had found a place but then that didn't work out. Then all these men and some other people decided they would create a barrier for me by surrounding me, with their backs to me, so I could change. I did that. Two of the women who were particularly close to me were trying to help me. I wanted to slip it down over my head and they said that wouldn't work. They said I wouldn't be able to keep myself covered that way so I stepped into the swimsuit and pulled it up. I removed my top while they simultaneously pulled my swimsuit up. This worked very well. I went into the shower. When Matthew came in he was a very small child, maybe only one year old. I'm not sure he could even sit up by himself. I was sitting on the floor of the shower and he was sitting with me, between my legs but facing away from me, as a parent and child might sit on the floor when playing. I was bathing him and all the candles were lit.",

         "Matthew and I are at Kings Island. We hadn't gone there for entertainment, but for some other reason. We were there early in the day. We were sitting there waiting for something or someone and I suggested to Matthew that maybe we could ride the roller coaster while we're there. He didn't immediately agree or disagree with me. Then we got up and started walking, maybe towards the roller coaster. We see Bev and John S. They are riding in something like a golf cart. They pull up along side us and we all stop to talk. We hadn't expected to see them. I'm thinking about the fact that I bet they come more often now that they have this cart because they don't have to do so much walking. That would make it less tiring and more enjoyable. They don't have their children with them. They take off again and Matthew and I decide to try to catch up with them. We get stopped in the crowd because there are so many people around we can't get through. Matthew sees something up ahead of us and says something like, oh there's....I can't remember what he said it was. I think it had something to do with us trying to catch up to Bev and John. He took off to go up to whatever it was. I think he was going to come right back. I stood there and waited and waited but he didn't come back. I got kind of upset. I thought he was just going 30 or 40 feet ahead of me. I finally made my way up there and he was no where to be seen. Then I got upset because I really do not like being in crowds, especially not alone. And no longer like being in unfamiliar places alone either. I was trying not to feel too panicked. Now, I'm standing next to one of the rides. At least that's what I think it is originally but it seems to have morphed into something that looks like a single slide, not that high, that ends in a single spiral at the bottom. People come down the slide and continue around this single spiral. I'm watching people come down. There are two employees at the top of the slide helping people. There are also a couple of employees at the bottom of the slide helping. Then I see a bunch of stuff come down the slide instead of people. It's stuff like people's belongings and bed linens and bath towels. Some of it is stuffed animals. As I'm standing there watching this I realize that there are groups of people, may families and this is a kind of entryway into the park. These groups of people are there for a specific reason other than to be visitors or for the entertainment and attractions. The employees are helping these groups of people enter the park through this slide. The groups of people have brought this stuff with them that I saw coming down the slide. Someone is taking the stuffed animals off of the slide one by one. The are relatively small, maybe 12-18 inches in length and not that big in width. They are more long and thin stuffed animals than short and chubby like a teddy bear. Someone is handing them to me. There is some kind of a shelf or box like container that is open on the side. They are handing the stuffed animals to me to stand them in this container. They want me to start at one end and line them up that way. It is only as deep as the stuffed animals are wide. Apparently I wasn't doing it the way they wanted me to and they showed me that they wanted the first one to face the wall of the container and then line each of the others up behind the first one facing the same way. It only held four or five of them. I'm in an indoor, underground location. The families each have their own area down there. It is a very long, not very wide, almost tunnel like area. The ceilings don't feel very high. The areas for each of the families are not divided by walls. In each area there is a platform type thing that is about five or six feet tall, maybe three feet wide, and about 10 or 12 feet long. On each and there is a set of steps leading up to the platform. The each look a little different than the others, in color or how they are constructed. For example, some of them may be carpeted, some are painted but in different colors, etc. as I'm walking through this area I realize that each of these families, or groups, are there for a competition. Perhaps it is a talent competition. These platforms are for them to practice on. They each have very different things that they are doing though, so it gives the feeling of something like a variety show or a circus, where there are lots of different types of acts. I'm walking through here trying to find Matthew, and I'm getting very frustrated. I decide that I need to go back up above ground to find him but now I can't find a place to go back above ground. All of these individual family areas with all of these staircases is causing me to feel more disoriented and confused. I see someone that I think maybe an employee there so I stop and ask them for directions to get back above ground. They try to give me directions but I think I must get confused again because I don't find it. I go back to the same person to ask again but they seemed to be irritated with me now. So I just walk away and keep trying myself. I finally find Matthew down there. He knows the way back above ground so we are going back up together and then go home. The place that we go up above ground is at the end of the tunnel. As we approach I see an area with exercise equipment. However, it's very unusual looking equipment, like nothing I've seen before. Some of it reminds me of the type of equipment a football team which used for practice, like the things they would use to practice tackling or things that they would be pushing against with their shoulders as they try to run forward. I feel very tense, like I have a lot of built-up anxiety or stress. I look at this equipment and think it might be a very good way for me to get rid of some of this tension. I'm standing there doing something with some of it trying to figure out how to use it. I asked Matthew, and he shows me how to use it. I noticed these things attached to some of the equipment. I see the same things are also attached some places on the walls. They look like a rectangular boxes and if you open them they contain plastic bottles for water or beverages. They look very dirty or a nasty. I decide it would be a nice thing to do to clean them up for whoever uses them. So go ahead and I clean them up and then someone who works there walks up to me. I told him what I did. Instead of appreciating it he seems bothered by the fact that I did this. Thank you I are now ready to go above ground. The way to get up is to climb up a ladder that is attached to the end wall. There is a fairly small opening at the top of the ladder that we have to crawl through to get out. Before we climb up the ladder we see these black rectangular kind of shape to object leaning against the wall. Matthew suggest that we each take one up with us to use and once we get through the opening. Apparently, once we get through the opening, we can't just stand up and walk through the park. I am now with three other people and Matthew is not one of those. We are trying to escape. We each of one of these black things though they now seem to be different sizes and shapes. We are going to use them as some kind of transportation, kind of like a sled though I don't know what is going to propel us. We see some other kind of objects and we each take two. There might be more than two. One appears to be something to sit on and the other, or others, we will use to propel us forward. However it is that they work were going to use them to get away, or to escape. It seems as though we are outdoors now and on pavement just inside the park. It looks like we are exiting the park on to a road. The place that were exiting from and the road they were exiting on to appears to have a downward slope. We are exiting at an angle on to the road. It reminds me of the way an entrance ramp to the highway enters on to the highway. And I we're concerned and one because of the traffic and cars being able to see us clearly with us being on these objects and so close to the ground also. It feels very dangerous. It seems to me that we'd pull off and stop to figure out what to do. Now we're running through the inside of a building, still in an effort to escape. The building looks like a huge warehouse and there is stuff everywhere. They're apparently isn't even room to walk, because to get through we have to actually run across the top of these piles all of boxes and such. Some of the piles of things aren't boxes, they are very soft and plush is maybe a good word to describe them. Almost as though they are piles of blankets or pillows. As we're doing this we notice some very large objects that are rectangular in shape. Like the thing is that we were using before they are plastic but these are in a variety of colors. I grab one that is lime green. They are long enough that we can sit upright on them and stretch out our legs in front of us. We each take one and are using them as sleds on something that I can best describe as a very long slide that goes through this building.But it's not straight, but rather winds through the building until we exit. This seems to happen several times. We exit one building and find ourselves in another find some kind of objects to use and slide our way winding through the building until we exit again and then the same thing happens over. At one point we exit on to a green grassy area. There are four or so employees each standing with a customer or guest, working with them to practice their golf putting. I hear one of the employees say that the park has a service for guests, where the guests can request the service of one of these employees for an entire day and the employee will help the guest with anything they want help with. I quickly tell the three people that I'm with about this. I suggest that maybe they can help us get away since they are required to help us with anything that we ask for help with. I tell them that I think it will be easier for us to get away if we have these employees hoping each of us. Maybe I think it's because they know their way around this area better, or maybe I think it's because if there's two of us on each of these objects we will be better able to get away simply because of having more manpower. So we end up telling for the employees that we want their services and so they have to help us. So we now each have an employee with us on these objects that we are trying to get away on. So now as were sliding through the building each of us with an employee with us on our slide it's the last time that this happens. The buildings are all fairly dark and dingy. There is no visible color, and very little light. The area that were moving through is just wide enough for these things that were using as sleds. The thing that we're sliding on through each of these buildings seems to change from time to time. As we get close to exiting this final building the employees warned us that we need to be very careful and try to slow ourselves down because we will be exiting onto water. They tell us that the water will become ice. We need to be especially careful at that point. It would enter the ice to fast we could get turned over and injured. So, we are all trying to slow down and brace ourselves preparing for this. I am second in line of before us and I see a head of me were getting ready to exit the building the water on the other side and it's like the rushing water. I become nervous and tense, wondering if we can even enter the water without getting dumped over. One as we get close to the place where the water turns to ice I notice something on the wall to my right. The wall itself appears to be gray cement. It looks like there is something like a foam forming on this wall. It reminds me of the type of insulation foam that is used in buildings, where they spray it on and then it expands, except it's not nearly that large. It is maybe an inch or two high but runs along the wall. The employee in front of me points to it and tells me that this is the ice forming. I turned a bit to my right and point this out to the person behind me and tell down that this employee has told me that this is the ice forming. So as the sled in front of me approaches the ice they managed to slow themselves down an off so they can enter the eye is more slowly and carefully so as not to get turned over and harmed. All I and the employee with me do the same thing as do the people behind us. We don't go very far until we see something running two are right that looks like a rail fence made of two by fours. Do to people on the sled in front of me slide underneath the lowest rail and down a very short but somewhat steep hill to the ground below. I can see that there are a lot of people standing down there watching for us. This appears to be a good thing, that these people recognize that we are helping someone. As the two people, the person who is with me originally and the employee, in front of me land on the ground below and stand up, some of the people who have been standing around watching run up to them to greet and hug them. The two people with me then go into a nearby building to get warm. I and the employee with me now does the same thing. And those behind me then do the same thing.",

         "Interpret this dream: Matthew and I are at Kings Island. We hadn't gone there for entertainment, but for some other reason. We were there early in the day. We were sitting there waiting for something or someone and I suggested to Matthew that maybe we could ride the roller coaster while we're there. He didn't immediately agree or disagree with me. Then we got up and started walking, maybe towards the roller coaster. We see Bev and John S. They are riding in something like a golf cart. They pull up along side us and we all stop to talk. We hadn't expected to see them. I'm thinking about the fact that I bet they come more often now that they have this cart because they don't have to do so much walking. That would make it less tiring and more enjoyable. They don't have their children with them. They take off again and Matthew and I decide to try to catch up with them. We get stopped in the crowd because there are so many people around we can't get through. Matthew sees something up ahead of us and says something like, oh there's....I can't remember what he said it was. I think it had something to do with us trying to catch up to Bev and John. He took off to go up to whatever it was. I think he was going to come right back. I stood there and waited and waited but he didn't come back. I got kind of upset. I thought he was just going 30 or 40 feet ahead of me. I finally made my way up there and he was no where to be seen. Then I got upset because I really do not like being in crowds, especially not alone. And no longer like being in unfamiliar places alone either. I was trying not to feel too panicked. Now, I'm standing next to one of the rides. At least that's what I think it is originally but it seems to have morphed into something that looks like a single slide, not that high, that ends in a single spiral at the bottom. People come down the slide and continue around this single spiral. I'm watching people come down. There are two employees at the top of the slide helping people. There are also a couple of employees at the bottom of the slide helping. Then I see a bunch of stuff come down the slide instead of people. It's stuff like people's belongings and bed linens and bath towels. Some of it is stuffed animals. As I'm standing there watching this I realize that there are groups of people, may families and this is a kind of entryway into the park. These groups of people are there for a specific reason other than to be visitors or for the entertainment and attractions. The employees are helping these groups of people enter the park through this slide. The groups of people have brought this stuff with them that I saw coming down the slide. Someone is taking the stuffed animals off of the slide one by one. The are relatively small, maybe 12-18 inches in length and not that big in width. They are more long and thin stuffed animals than short and chubby like a teddy bear. Someone is handing them to me. There is some kind of a shelf or box like container that is open on the side. They are handing the stuffed animals to me to stand them in this container. They want me to start at one end and line them up that way. It is only as deep as the stuffed animals are wide. Apparently I wasn't doing it the way they wanted me to and they showed me that they wanted the first one to face the wall of the container and then line each of the others up behind the first one facing the same way. It only held four or five of them. I'm in an indoor, underground location. The families each have their own area down there. It is a very long, not very wide, almost tunnel like area. The ceilings don't feel very high. The areas for each of the families are not divided by walls. In each area there is a platform type thing that is about five or six feet tall, maybe three feet wide, and about 10 or 12 feet long. On each and there is a set of steps leading up to the platform. The each look a little different than the others, in color or how they are constructed. For example, some of them may be carpeted, some are painted but in different colors, etc. as I'm walking through this area I realize that each of these families, or groups, are there for a competition. Perhaps it is a talent competition. These platforms are for them to practice on. They each have very different things that they are doing though, so it gives the feeling of something like a variety show or a circus, where there are lots of different types of acts. I'm walking through here trying to find Matthew, and I'm getting very frustrated. I decide that I need to go back up above ground to find him but now I can't find a place to go back above ground. All of these individual family areas with all of these staircases is causing me to feel more disoriented and confused. I see someone that I think maybe an employee there so I stop and ask them for directions to get back above ground.

         "The dream started off in sort of an ancient Greek stage, probably because I was reading some Greek drama last night. It seemed that when someone died that there was this huge massive tunnel under the, where apparently the spirit went and certain people who had been Christian? in life could follow them a certain way thru this maze and, for instance, it was very much made a point of that the nurse could follow it a short way and if this had been a man in white, the white could follow it the furthest of all. And for this purpose one had keys, small little keys with a certain number on them and these numbers could be from one to ten and they corresponded to the numbers of the tunnels and labyrinths in the maze. The nurse would get one key and the wife would get three. Now apparently in this dream my husband had died, although I wasn't exactly myself, so my husband wouldn't be exactly the man I'm married to. But I got three keys and the nurse got a key which was numbered 7 and I got one with numbers 3, 7, and 10. So I went out, first I went down, these were wooden and were ruins in the start of this tunnel bit. I went down thru the nurse's door, which was an ordinary door, and I looked around there for a few minutes. It was old and dusty and it was closed up. It was like an attic or something. I went back up and there was a little door on the side of the wall here which was, I had a key for, but it was a small door and I had to get down on my hands and knees to get thru and I didn't much like it. It gave me sort of claustrophobia, but I did. I was very much worried about losing the keys in the cracks in the floor, and I thought if I drop these keys, there were very small, very thin, if they slip thru the cracks, then I won't have any way to get back because you're supposed to lock the doors behind you when you went thru them. So I held on to them very tightly. I was in another room, this shut-up looking room, which was like the one I had been in before in the nurse's part of the tunnel, and there was another small door leading out of it on the other side, so I decided to go out of it and I did. Then this is a little vague in my mind, but I think I was wandering around in a tunnel or a level or whatever it was, and this maze was completely fantastic. It's beyond words to describe the thing because tunnels and tunnels and tunnels intersected each other and it might be any from one thru ten. I guess in actual practice most of them seemed to be numbered with the keys I had and there was marked with the numbers right into each of these, and you could just wander forever. You would never get to the end of these things and it first seemed they were all closed in tunnels, and then I decided to stop traveling. So I took the opportunity to get out onto this 7 and then I was outside on this ramp and all these ramps were painted gray with different levels. There were stairs going up and down, usually very short ones. Even though they were steps, they didn't look like ordinary flights of stairs, but anyway I was outside and I was sort of glad to be outside. It was fairly pretty. All of these were off the ground. There were none of them that were right on the ground, but there were no rails on either side of the thing. It gave the appearance of being close to the ground because there were trees and things or bushes and vines and things around it. As I went along this ramp or whatever you want to call it, I came to a place where there was a room and there was a big picture window in it, and I could see somebody sitting inside it. I passed thru other places, but they had all been empty. They were all furnished. They weren't this attic type room that I had first been in, but they were empty. But this one had somebody sitting in it and it was this Negro man about 40 or so studying, and he has a sort of evil look about him. I went around and I pounded at the door. When he opened the door, I asked him something. I think I asked him if he knew where somebody was or if  he had seen them or something, but he hadn't, so I went on and I was still outside and it got more and more lovely. It was sort of an Alice in Wonderland type of scene. What I mean by this is a Walt Disney Alice in Wonderland with all these flowers growing up around on either side of this ramp, all very lush and pretty. Sort of unusual flowers too. They didn't have quite a real look about them. So I came to another room which had this boy sitting in it and the boy was about 14 and he was reading something. I knocked on the door and he came to it and let me in and for some reason I was very happy to see him. I never saw him before that I know of, but I was sort of attracted by him. I wanted to kiss him, but he pushed me away and said no because his parents were in the next room. And I thought this was very unusual because I thought most people didn't get here all in one group. It really did seem to be in the underworld or after death and I wondered how he and his parents could have all gotten here at the same time and all be in the same place. His parents were very, very old. They were white-haired and they were both tall and thin, and they were just sitting in the next room on straight back chairs with their hands folded, not looking exactly dead like, but like they might have been in their 70's. It seemed the boy didn't say anything, his parents didn't say anything, but it seems that I understood or knew somehow that this boy had killed somebody or was some sort of psychotic and had been sent here and his parents had come as guardians to be sure he didn't do anything like this again, although who he was planning to kill, I'm not sure since it seemed to be the world of the dead. And even though these people are flesh and blood and quite alive, and yet they were dead in some way. I wasn't. I was, I had gotten down here sort of free or something, but at any rate I don't know exactly what happened. But all of a sudden I knew that this boy was dangerous and he was going to try to kill me or something. He had a knife and this piece of wood about a foot and a half long or so, and I had a piece of wood too. I don't know where I had found it, but it wasn't as long as his and he was trying to hit me with this piece of wood. I was trying to fight him off, but I knew that I wouldn't be too successful because his was longer than mine. So we started running thru all these lovely ramps and walkways thru all these pass ways, these rooms, around, upstairs and so forth in this long flight. Even though we were both running very fast, neither one of us seemed to get tired, and I wasn't really particularly scared. But I just wanted to get away from him. Something or somehow another I got his knife away from him. It was one of these, like a Boy Scout knife or some pocket knife, and I decided I would just get rid of him. And so I sort of stabbed him in his chest, but not very hard, cause I really couldn't, and I was going to make him jump off the ramp and just, well, it wasn't that far down to the ground, but at least I would get rid of him because he wouldn't be able to get back on it. So I kept threatening him with it and telling him to jump over the edge, but he wouldn't do it, and so finally, even though I had this knife, I started running away from him again. This time I was trying to get rid of him and remembered my keys and knew I could get rid of him by going into the doors numbered this, but I didn't know what keys he might have and I didn't know if he could follow me or not. I had this feeling he wouldn't be able to, but still to stop long enough to open the door and then lock it again, he would catch up with me. So I was running and running and we ran up, finally we came to where, in fact, the ramp did run right along the ground and there was a big plain, flat and just with grass on it. This ramp or walkway now you might call it was a big building which was a school and so we ran there. I was, of course, running away from him and I tried to lose myself in the mazes of this school some way. But even though I ran inside the building and started running down the stairs, he could easily spot me because all the girls in the school had these white lab coats and I didn't. I just had ordinary clothes, sort of dark clothes, and so I ran down some flights of stairs with him running after me, and I got down to the place where all these Negro janitors were going home and they were all lined up. There was this immense number of them and they were just all lined up in a row, and they had the same outfits. There was something strange about them because they were all so much alike, but then I knew they'd be going down into the tunnel and it would be different from the ones we ordinarily used, and so I knew if I got in there with them, this other person wouldn't' suspect where I was, so I did get in and the door was closed behind me and I was safe. Then the scene shifted to a larger view. I believe there was a P.A. system and an announcement was made over it that this girl had just reached the gift shop. And I think it was called the Shop of Mercy and Hate on the 3rd level, and that, therefore, she was free and this girl was me. When you got to this shop apparently, whatever it was, you had your choice between these two things, and if you picked the right one, you would be able to go. If you were dead when you reached this and you wanted to, you would be able to get back to the living world again. Even though I wasn't dead, but this also I was going to get. So the boy was sort of upset that he had missed out on this, and so he went up around the ramps and walkways till he got close to where the gift shop was supposed to be, and there the girl came out and she was thinking, well, even though this boy had been chasing her and she hadn't liked it, that if she saw him she would be merciful to him. And she was walking along with this person, whether it was a man or woman, I don't know, all dressed in white, some sort of angel, I guess, a very superior being. There was a shelf over the door and I believe it was the door to the gift shop that had all these cheeses sitting on it and most of these were, I forget the name of them, the kind that are wrapped in wax and some of them weren't. And apparently it had rained because some of them were soggy looking, but I was sort of back with this girl now and had a package of cheese, and it wasn't quite the same kind, but it was unusual cheese. And I don't think I ever saw one exactly like it because it had a lot of holes in it like Swiss cheese, and it was sliced very thin and it had sort of a reddish something, coloration, some fluid. Well, this boy was walking along behind us and I had this cheese, and so I stopped and asked him if he wanted some. I don't know, but anyway he did, and so I and this angel character and this boy all stood around and ate several slices of cheese and bread and apparently I was going off to the airport or something to be taken back to where I was supposed to be, and this is where I and the angel were headed to, the airport. Right then we were just standing there eating this cheese and that was about the end of the dream.",

         "Interpret this dream: The dream started off in sort of an ancient Greek stage, probably because I was reading some Greek drama last night. It seemed that when someone died that there was this huge massive tunnel under the, where apparently the spirit went and certain people who had been Christian? in life could follow them a certain way thru this maze and, for instance, it was very much made a point of that the nurse could follow it a short way and if this had been a man in white, the white could follow it the furthest of all. And for this purpose one had keys, small little keys with a certain number on them and these numbers could be from one to ten and they corresponded to the numbers of the tunnels and labyrinths in the maze. The nurse would get one key and the wife would get three. Now apparently in this dream my husband had died, although I wasn't exactly myself, so my husband wouldn't be exactly the man I'm married to. But I got three keys and the nurse got a key which was numbered 7 and I got one with numbers 3, 7, and 10. So I went out, first I went down, these were wooden and were ruins in the start of this tunnel bit. I went down thru the nurse's door, which was an ordinary door, and I looked around there for a few minutes. It was old and dusty and it was closed up. It was like an attic or something. I went back up and there was a little door on the side of the wall here which was, I had a key for, but it was a small door and I had to get down on my hands and knees to get thru and I didn't much like it. It gave me sort of claustrophobia, but I did. I was very much worried about losing the keys in the cracks in the floor, and I thought if I drop these keys, there were very small, very thin, if they slip thru the cracks, then I won't have any way to get back because you're supposed to lock the doors behind you when you went thru them. So I held on to them very tightly. I was in another room, this shut-up looking room, which was like the one I had been in before in the nurse's part of the tunnel, and there was another small door leading out of it on the other side, so I decided to go out of it and I did. Then this is a little vague in my mind, but I think I was wandering around in a tunnel or a level or whatever it was, and this maze was completely fantastic. It's beyond words to describe the thing because tunnels and tunnels and tunnels intersected each other and it might be any from one thru ten. I guess in actual practice most of them seemed to be numbered with the keys I had and there was marked with the numbers right into each of these, and you could just wander forever. You would never get to the end of these things and it first seemed they were all closed in tunnels, and then I decided to stop traveling. So I took the opportunity to get out onto this 7 and then I was outside on this ramp and all these ramps were painted gray with different levels. There were stairs going up and down, usually very short ones. Even though they were steps, they didn't look like ordinary flights of stairs, but anyway I was outside and I was sort of glad to be outside. It was fairly pretty. All of these were off the ground. There were none of them that were right on the ground, but there were no rails on either side of the thing. It gave the appearance of being close to the ground because there were trees and things or bushes and vines and things around it. As I went along this ramp or whatever you want to call it, I came to a place where there was a room and there was a big picture window in it, and I could see somebody sitting inside it. I passed thru other places, but they had all been empty. They were all furnished. They weren't this attic type room that I had first been in, but they were empty. But this one had somebody sitting in it and it was this Negro man about 40 or so studying, and he has a sort of evil look about him. I went around and I pounded at the door. When he opened the door, I asked him something. I think I asked him if he knew where somebody was or if  he had seen them or something, but he hadn't, so I went on and I was still outside and it got more and more lovely. It was sort of an Alice in Wonderland type of scene. What I mean by this is a Walt Disney Alice in Wonderland with all these flowers growing up around on either side of this ramp, all very lush and pretty. Sort of unusual flowers too. They didn't have quite a real look about them. So I came to another room which had this boy sitting in it and the boy was about 14 and he was reading something. I knocked on the door and he came to it and let me in and for some reason I was very happy to see him. I never saw him before that I know of, but I was sort of attracted by him. I wanted to kiss him, but he pushed me away and said no because his parents were in the next room. And I thought this was very unusual because I thought most people didn't get here all in one group. It really did seem to be in the underworld or after death and I wondered how he and his parents could have all gotten here at the same time and all be in the same place. His parents were very, very old. They were white-haired and they were both tall and thin, and they were just sitting in the next room on straight back chairs with their hands folded, not looking exactly dead like, but like they might have been in their 70's. It seemed the boy didn't say anything, his parents didn't say anything, but it seems that I understood or knew somehow that this boy had killed somebody or was some sort of psychotic and had been sent here and his parents had come as guardians to be sure he didn't do anything like this again, although who he was planning to kill, I'm not sure since it seemed to be the world of the dead. And even though these people are flesh and blood and quite alive, and yet they were dead in some way. I wasn't. I was, I had gotten down here sort of free or something, but at any rate I don't know exactly what happened. But all of a sudden I knew that this boy was dangerous and he was going to try to kill me or something. He had a knife and this piece of wood about a foot and a half long or so, and I had a piece of wood too. I don't know where I had found it, but it wasn't as long as his and he was trying to hit me with this piece of wood. I was trying to fight him off, but I knew that I wouldn't be too successful because his was longer than mine. So we started running thru all these lovely ramps and walkways thru all these pass ways, these rooms, around, upstairs and so forth in this long flight. Even though we were both running very fast, neither one of us seemed to get tired, and I wasn't really particularly scared. But I just wanted to get away from him. Something or somehow another I got his knife away from him. It was one of these, like a Boy Scout knife or some pocket knife, and I decided I would just get rid of him. And so I sort of stabbed him in his chest, but not very hard, cause I really couldn't, and I was going to make him jump off the ramp and just, well, it wasn't that far down to the ground, but at least I would get rid of him because he wouldn't be able to get back on it. So I kept threatening him with it and telling him to jump over the edge, but he wouldn't do it, and so finally, even though I had this knife, I started running away from him again. This time I was trying to get rid of him and remembered my keys and knew I could get rid of him by going into the doors numbered this, but I didn't know what keys he might have and I didn't know if he could follow me or not. I had this feeling he wouldn't be able to, but still to stop long enough to open the door and then lock it again, he would catch up with me. So I was running and running and we ran up, finally we came to where, in fact, the ramp did run right along the ground and there was a big plain, flat and just with grass on it. This ramp or walkway now you might call it was a big building which was a school and so we ran there. I was, of course, running away from him and I tried to lose myself in the mazes of this school some way. But even though I ran inside the building and started running down the stairs, he could easily spot me because all the girls in the school had these white lab coats and I didn't. I just had ordinary clothes, sort of dark clothes, and so I ran down some flights of stairs with him running after me, and I got down to the place where all these Negro janitors were going home and they were all lined up. There was this immense number of them and they were just all lined up in a row, and they had the same outfits. There was something strange about them because they were all so much alike, but then I knew they'd be going down into the tunnel and it would be different from the ones we ordinarily used, and so I knew if I got in there with them, this other person wouldn't' suspect where I was, so I did get in and the door was closed behind me and I was safe. Then the scene shifted to a larger view. I believe there was a P.A. system and an announcement was made over it that this girl had just reached the gift shop. And I think it was called the Shop of Mercy and Hate on the 3rd level, and that, therefore, she was free and this girl was me. When you got to this shop apparently, whatever it was, you had your choice between these two things, and if you picked the right one, you would be able to go. If you were dead when you reached this and you wanted to, you would be able to get back to the living world again. Even though I wasn't dead, but this also I was going to get.

There was a shelf over the door and I believe it was the door to the gift shop that had all these cheeses sitting on it and most of these were, I forget the name of them, the kind that are wrapped in wax and some of them weren't.

         "I was the housekeeper for a man and his young son, similar to the movie Sleepless in Seattle. I had been working for them for nearly a year when they began the search for a new wife for the man. I was in love with him by this time. They found his new wife and I was experiencing the expected feelings about the entire situation, but I did not end my employment there. I did not feel the marriage would work out and I didn't want the man to feel worse when he found himself without a wife or a housekeeper. Shortly after they married, the wife became pregnant with their child. She gave birth to twins. Shortly thereafter she left him but took the twins with her. He was heartbroken and I for him. Within a month or so after she left she returned with the children, but only to leave the children with him to raise. She said she was not ready to raise the children. The man was a fisherman by profession. He had numerous fishing containers setup outside his house. They mostly had wood frames made of 4x4 beams. They were around 4 _ feet tall, 7 feet long and 2 or 3 feet wide. The top ledges were only a few inches wide. I took a bike outside and was riding very fast around the ledges of these various containers. They were all full of water. I don't know if they had different kinds of fish in them or what exactly was in them. The man's mother was concerned for me that I was riding a bike around these ledges, especially since I was riding so fast and turning practically on my side as I made some of the corners. I was somewhat frightened and yet surprised at how confident I felt in my ability to do this successfully. The man gave me a net the size you would use in an indoor aquarium and some ziplock bags. He sent me to one of the containers to begin catching fish. I found I was just as successful using my hand as using the net. All of the fish were about the size of aquarium fish but some larger than others. Some seemed impossible to see, either because they were so thin or because of their coloring. I'm not sure which. Others were larger and blue and white in color. I filled one bag. There was a lot of discussion going on between this man and his parents about this woman and the children. At this point the man was my ex-husband, Darren. When the woman returned with the babies we were in the midst of having a yard sale. Each of the containers now had flat tops covering them and we were sitting things for the yard sale on them. I found boxes of jewelry that I had put away because they were related, primarily, to my marriage to my ex-husband. There were a lot of earrings that were bride & groom and such. There were other earrings that I asked Bev if she would allow Mari Kate S to wear. Bev tried to describe what she would want to wear and what she would be allowed to wear. Jody S was also trying to help clarify for me. Mari Kate S finally came out and was looking through them. I picked up a few pairs and pointed them out to Bev and Jody S. They were some of my favorites from the past that I had been saving, hoping they would come back in style. Kay H brought a number of things out that I loved. Some of it was jewelry but others were knick-knacks I was quite surprised that she didn't tell me to just take the things I wanted. After the yard sale was over we were moving everything back into the garage. Kay H and Darren didn't think I knew how to properly care for the twins, so I let them take care of them and I concentrated on organizing the garage. Ray H had a few shelves in the garage with various glass and plastic items sitting on them. I wanted to put all like items together and move the glass items to the sturdiest shelves. In examining the shelves I realized that one was simply made up of a nylon fabric and resembled a kite. It also had hinges so it could be dropped similar to a drop leaf on a drop-leaf table. I realized it was useless for storage. I went to another shelf that was a huge half-circle that protruded far into the room. I was trying to move some of the furniture and things along the walls so I could move around more easily and get to these shelves more easily. In doing so I nearly knocked quite a few of the glass items to the floor. Actually I think I did knock some of them off but don't recall anything breaking. Near this one unusual shelf was also an unusual metal rack on the wall that was being used to hold glasses and such. This rack rested flat against the wall but hinges allowed different sections to be pulled just far enough away from the wall to allow you to slip an upside down stack of glasses on it. There were quite a few pieces, 100 or more, of one type of blue glassware. Some of them were on this wall rack and others were on the large semi-circular shelf. I was going to put them all on the shelf but then realized that shelf would not support all the weight. I was going to put them all on the rack but then Kay H came out and began telling me how to do that as well. Just for fun, someone suggested some kind of contest involving the number of garage sale items we were each working with. An adult was to represent a child. I was representing Rachel S. I would have won except that I did not get my items counted fast enough, primarily because I had so many more than the others. which is, oddly, what it took to win but you had to have them counted in time too. We are back to dealing with and arguing about the care of the twins. The size of the twins kept changing. they weren't even as big as my hand. At another time, one was nearly the normal size of a newborn and the other was less than the size of my hand. Then they were pieces of paper rather than actual babies, but each baby was two pieces of paper rather than just one. There was some discussion about where the twins would sleep and where Darren and I would sleep. Certainly, I had no desire to share a bed with him as the mother of the twins had done and yet somehow that seemed to be critical to the nocturnal care of the twins. The bed was not a normal bed however. It was more like a sofa with a cot in front of it. We each sat on one end of the sofa and stretched our legs out onto the cot. For some reason it was finally decided that I was to leave and take the twins with me. It is unclear to me if I was to take them permanently or if I was taking them on a purposeful journey. I was to take this journey on horseback, alone with the twins. There was a man helping me to prepare the horse, saddling him and putting the things I would need in the saddlebags, etc. I am traveling on a Native American pilgrimage with Matthew. I have the sense that the purpose of this pilgrimage was primarily for Matthew but somewhere along the way I realized that I was and would continue to derive as much if not more from this journey as he would. We had several things that Matthew had to accomplish on this journey. I believe it was to include two nights out in the woods. There were a number of people on the same journey, so we found we were not alone in figuring out what to do or knowing what we needed to do or how to accomplish those things. I was glad to know this. We became very fond of our fellow travelers. I became more in love with Native American Culture than I had even previously been. The people were wonderful and the traditions and rituals were so rich and wonderful. The rituals were wonderful not just because of the ritual itself but because of the transformation Matthew and I, and others, experienced as a result of completing each ritual. there was something that would be beneficial for Matthew to acquire. Oddly, the only way he could acquire it was to purchase it. It was quite expensive and I realized that neither he nor I could, or should, spend that much money on that item. An elderly Native American man sold it to us for what we told him Matthew had in his bank account which was around $16.99. I felt bad because we lied to him. Matthew had nearly $35 in his account, which was the actual price of the item. I didn't want Matthew to be totally broke so I lied to the man about how much money Matthew had. This struck me as particularly odd because I knew I wouldn't normally do this. When Matthew was writing the check to the man, I made sure he kept hidden the total from his check register. There were several scenes in which the entire group was riding horseback to our next destination or ritual. We were told that for one of the rituals Matthew would need to entirely undress. I knew Matthew would be uncomfortable with this but understood the purpose of the ritual and thought it would be very beneficial. I realized how beneficial it would be for me so I participated in the ritual as well. It was incredibly freeing, as though my soul had been freed. It was exhilarating. I became totally hooked on the entire process and future opportunities. When we settled into our campsite for the night we were preparing meals. I was having a little trouble contemplating eating the food that we were expected to eat. I couldn't bring myself to eat the first thing. The next thing they brought was the foot of some very large animal. It still had the fur on it and everything, but it had been cooked. I cut off two toes. I gave one to someone else and then I ate one. I was surprised that it didn't taste too bad. It seems that I was even eating the fur and didn't mind it. In our next ritual we were given some freedom in how we completed it. Given how great it felt to be able to complete the ritual of being completely nude in front of all these strangers I decided that I would remove most of my clothing and due a Native American dance around the campfire. Everyone admired the progress I made and my new level of confidence. I thought about the twins, thinking something like oh, yes. The twins. I pointed them out or said something about them to the others. Later I thought, wait a minute. I started out with the twins. I can't just not have them in the dream anymore. So I remember thinking something about having them in a type of papoose on my back. We are now sitting in another location talking about future similar, but advanced, journeys we can complete. We would do so in a certain order. To progress to each journey we would need to adequately complete the requirements of the prior and be living a certain lifestyle. At this point I am writing notes on a piece of paper about the things I need to do so I can achieve this level and move on to the next journey. Some of the things this included were writing on a more natural kind of paper and wearing different kinds of jewelry. like more things with feathers and such. There was some type of Native American title that went with the completion of this journey. I can't remember now what it was. It started with a T. Tahoe? Tecumseh? I don't know now. While we are at this place there are also containers sitting around for trash and other things. I was trying to get all the trash into the right container, as I knew that was a perfect example of this new lifestyle. At first another woman or two was somewhat deterring me from what I was attempting. They did not see it as that important. Then someone came around to collect the trash and had a momentary conversation with me about it and I realized that I was right. There were also binders and books sitting around. The speaker was talking about various things we could do to complete the various journeys. She mentioned something about Deepak Chopra. I recall seeing other names. There were other rituals but I don't recall what they were now. I went on a short horseback ride with someone else. There was something sexual about this experience. I was trying to help this other person heighten their sexual awareness or be able to get more pleasure from sexual experiences. On our way home I was riding with a man I had just then met. We clicked immediately and fully.",

I would have won except that I did not get my items counted fast enough, primarily because I had so many more than the others. which is, oddly, what it took to win but you had to have them counted in time too. We are back to dealing with and arguing about the care of the twins. The size of the twins kept changing. they weren't even as big as my hand. At another time, one was nearly the normal size of a newborn and the other was less than the size of my hand. Then they were pieces of paper rather than actual babies, but each baby was two pieces of paper rather than just one. There was some discussion about where the twins would sleep and where Darren and I would sleep. Certainly, I had no desire to share a bed with him as the mother of the twins had done and yet somehow that seemed to be critical to the nocturnal care of the twins. The bed was not a normal bed however. It was more like a sofa with a cot in front of it. We each sat on one end of the sofa and stretched our legs out onto the cot. For some reason it was finally decided that I was to leave and take the twins with me. It is unclear to me if I was to take them permanently or if I was taking them on a purposeful journey. I was to take this journey on horseback, alone with the twins. There was a man helping me to prepare the horse, saddling him and putting the things I would need in the saddlebags, etc. I am traveling on a Native American pilgrimage with Matthew. I have the sense that the purpose of this pilgrimage was primarily for Matthew but somewhere along the way I realized that I was and would continue to derive as much if not more from this journey as he would. We had several things that Matthew had to accomplish on this journey. I believe it was to include two nights out in the woods. There were a number of people on the same journey, so we found we were not alone in figuring out what to do or knowing what we needed to do or how to accomplish those things. I was glad to know this. We became very fond of our fellow travelers. I became more in love with Native American Culture than I had even previously been. The people were wonderful and the traditions and rituals were so rich and wonderful. The rituals were wonderful not just because of the ritual itself but because of the transformation Matthew and I, and others, experienced as a result of completing each ritual. there was something that would be beneficial for Matthew to acquire. Oddly, the only way he could acquire it was to purchase it. It was quite expensive and I realized that neither he nor I could, or should, spend that much money on that item. An elderly Native American man sold it to us for what we told him Matthew had in his bank account which was around $16.99. I felt bad because we lied to him. Matthew had nearly $35 in his account, which was the actual price of the item. I didn't want Matthew to be totally broke so I lied to the man about how much money Matthew had. This struck me as particularly odd because I knew I wouldn't normally do this. When Matthew was writing the check to the man, I made sure he kept hidden the total from his check register. There were several scenes in which the entire group was riding horseback to our next destination or ritual. We were told that for one of the rituals Matthew would need to entirely undress. I knew Matthew would be uncomfortable with this but understood the purpose of the ritual and thought it would be very beneficial. I realized how beneficial it would be for me so I participated in the ritual as well. It was incredibly freeing, as though my soul had been freed. It was exhilarating. I became totally hooked on the entire process and future opportunities. When we settled into our campsite for the night we were preparing meals. I was having a little trouble contemplating eating the food that we were expected to eat. I couldn't bring myself to eat the first thing. The next thing they brought was the foot of some very large animal. It still had the fur on it and everything, but it had been cooked. I cut off two toes. I gave one to someone else and then I ate one. I was surprised that it didn't taste too bad. It seems that I was even eating the fur and didn't mind it. In our next ritual we were given some freedom in how we completed it. Given how great it felt to be able to complete the ritual of being completely nude in front of all these strangers I decided that I would remove most of my clothing and due a Native American dance around the campfire. Everyone admired the progress I made and my new level of confidence. I thought about the twins, thinking something like oh, yes. The twins. I pointed them out or said something about them to the others. Later I thought, wait a minute. I started out with the twins. I can't just not have them in the dream anymore. So I remember thinking something about having them in a type of papoose on my back. We are now sitting in another location talking about future similar, but advanced, journeys we can complete. We would do so in a certain order. To progress to each journey we would need to adequately complete the requirements of the prior and be living a certain lifestyle. At this point I am writing notes on a piece of paper about the things I need to do so I can achieve this level and move on to the next journey. Some of the things this included were writing on a more natural kind of paper and wearing different kinds of jewelry. like more things with feathers and such. There was some type of Native American title that went with the completion of this journey. I can't remember now what it was. It started with a T. Tahoe? Tecumseh? I don't know now. While we are at this place there are also containers sitting around for trash and other things. I was trying to get all the trash into the right container, as I knew that was a perfect example of this new lifestyle. At first another woman or two was somewhat deterring me from what I was attempting. They did not see it as that important. Then someone came around to collect the trash and had a momentary conversation with me about it and I realized that I was right. There were also binders and books sitting around. The speaker was talking about various things we could do to complete the various journeys. She mentioned something about Deepak Chopra. I recall seeing other names. There were other rituals but I don't recall what they were now. I went on a short horseback ride with someone else. There was something sexual about this experience. I was trying to help this other person heighten their sexual awareness or be able to get more pleasure from sexual experiences. On our way home I was riding with a man I had just then met. We clicked immediately and fully.\nSymbols: - Child: To dream that you lose a child represents losing hope.

         "Most of this nightmare felt like a chase scene from a movie. I was at my birth home spending the night. Bev was a child, maybe six or seven years old. I was in bed doing something on my laptop. I put the laptop away and tried to go to sleep. I couldn't get comfortable so I finally took my clothes off, thinking that no one ever comes in the room or even opens the door without my permission when I'm spending the night there. A few minutes later Bev came and crawled into bed. I decided I would quietly my clothes back on as soon as she fell asleep and in the meantime I would just make sure there were always blankets between us. Something seemed to be wrong but she wouldn't say much. Mother came in the room and gave her what must have been a favorite doll that was wrapped in two blankets. A little while later Mother came in the room with a small bouquet of flowers and gave those to Bev, laying them with her in bed. I thought this was very odd. After Mother left the room I coaxed Bev into talking to me. She wasn't feeling well physically. Mother had given her something and then brought the doll and the flowers in for comfort. I moved the blankets off of bed because of the flowers and realized that mother had wrapped Bev in two plastic bags. The one closest to her was the kind of plastic bag you use for fresh produce at a grocery store, but Bev fit in it completely. There was another plastic bag over the top of it. They were completely stuck to her body because they were making her so hot. I quickly took them off of her for fear of what they would do to her. I became furious with Mother for doing this and wondered why she would do such a thing, especially to Bev. I moved her close to me and just held her close to me and rubbed her back to comfort her. I think I was trying to comfort myself as much as her. I reached over to set my alarm so I wouldn't oversleep in the morning. As I did I hit the sleep button instead of the button to set the time on the alarm. This aggravated me because I didn't want to be listening to music for a half hour. I turned the volume way down and hoped I would remember to turn it back up in a half hour. Other members of the family showed up and came into the room. Mother and Daddy stayed in their bedroom the whole time. We began talking about some of the things they had done to all of us over the years. A few decided that it was time to confront them and then walk away. I asked Bev if she would want to come and live with me and she said yes. I didn't want to leave her there after that. Then Todd A came and sat next to her and she cuddled up to him. I asked her if she would rather live with me or be wherever Todd A was and she said with Todd A. I was surprised and hurt but did my best not to show it. Bob F had each of us write a note to Mother and Daddy on small note cards. I didn't want to do it. I was concerned about what this would do to Daddy, since he is the more fragile of the two, both emotionally and physically. I finally wrote something but I didn't even know how to begin to put into words what I felt, especially on this little card. I don't think what I wrote was even close to accurate. It was more of something just to appease my siblings. After everyone was done writing their notes Bob F took them to their bedroom, gave them to them, and then returned to my room. I told Bev she needed to pack a few things right away. We were all just going to leave. Bev kept getting distracted and I kept trying to get her focused on getting some things together so we could leave. We were all going to leave together so no one person was left alone to possibly face them. Before we could leave they walked into my bedroom. It's a small room so it seemed like wall-to-wall people. There was just barely room for them to step inside the door. I don't remember much of the conversation except that they tried to address a few of us individually about what we had written on the card. When they got to me, I mostly told them that they could never accept me for who I am and what I want to do with my life. They responded and as tears came to my eyes my voice cracked as I told them I've never been able to just be myself around them and we've never been able to talk to them. Mother walked out of the room for a couple of minutes and then returned with what appeared to be a six or so medicine tablets in her hand. She began to tell me how she had found these laying here and there when I was still living at home, before I got married. I looked at the small white, round pills and asked what they were. Daddy asked me what they looked like. I just looked up at him and then at Mother and knew immediately that they were birth control pills. Mother looked at me with the same disgust that had become familiar to me so many years ago. I got angry and asked her why she would save them, especially all of these years. Before she had a chance to answer I asked her if it made her angry because I didn't talk to her first like Bev did. I reminded her that she suggested that Bev move in with her fianc_e before she got married. At least I didn't do that. They both turned and walked out of the run and we all left. I kept Bev close to me because I knew this would be most upsetting to her. I thought she and I were going to get in BJ's car but then Brian F told me that BJ was riding with her and there was room for us in his car because it was some unusual kind of car with three rows of seats. As Bev and I got in the middle seat I saw the third row of seats behind us. Now we were trying to get away without someone catching us. We seemed to be on the high school property. There were quite a few buildings and there were cement steps what seemed to be about every hundred feet or so. They were very close together. Each time we came to a set of steps there were three flights. The first flight went one direction, the next flight went in the opposite direction, and the third flight in the same direction as the first. Brian F backed down the flights of steps in his car. He went so fast that I was frightened but he did it so cleanly that I realized he had done this more than once before. As is typical for him, he was laughing as he did it. Sometimes he took these hills that were as steep down and then immediately up again just like a roller coaster. Bev and I neither one liked it at all and I told him so. He said it was necessary. I didn't recognize or know a few of the people with us. They were friends of some of the family members. We had to stop for a little while for some reason. One of the females with us that I didn't know decided she was going to use the restroom while we were stopped. The restroom was not enclosed along the front. It was a long row of stalls with doors, but no walls. It was night time so you couldn't see much. If I strained my eyes I could see her feet under the stall door. It was a coed restroom. She took so long we kept asking her if she was okay or if she was about ready to go. She finally came out and now we had to wait for someone else. I decided to use the restroom very quickly before we left again. Six or eight other family members followed me. Now there were no walls to the stalls. It was just three long rows of toilets out in the open. I was very embarrassed and didn't like this when the other family members came in but none of them seemed to mind. An employee was standing there waiting for us to leave so she could close up for the night. I quickly got up and walked away. After everyone else was back in the cars I went back to the restroom hoping to use it in private but the woman had replaced all of the toilets with tan plastic chairs. We were no longer in cars. We were in something that reminds me of the cars of a roller coaster at an amusement park, except that each car could only seat one person and the person in front actually drove it. There were several of these though, with several members of the family in each. The first couple of times that we got out and back in I put Bev in the seat with me even though the seat was only made to hold one person. I had her wear the seatbelt. The last two times we got out and back in Bev wanted to sit alone in the very back seat. I said okay, but frequently turned around to check on her. We were now traveling on rails that looked somewhat like roller coaster tracks, except the look of what was on the bottom of them changed frequently. There were three or four different looks in all. The track was barely wider than the width of an adult. Some times we traveled on them much faster than others. People who worked on this property knew we were there and were chasing us. Peggy F and some of Bob F's boys were with us. Mari Kate S was with us and was car sick. She was sitting right behind me. Nothing I suggested to her helped her. Now the car that I was in was being driven by someone I didn't know. He stopped the car long enough to put a plastic tub next to her in case she became too ill. We got split up. They started pointing guns at us. Brian F pulled out a gun, shot, and killed one of the men. I was horrified and even more concerned about what this was all doing to Bev. The others let us think we were all getting away and then I suddenly saw a series of explosions on a track a little distance from us. I could only watch as I realized that members of my family were being killed one-by-one. I was too upset to even scream or cry. I was trying to think who might have been in that car. I got out and began running with Bev. I thought we were getting away. As we kept running, down steps, sliding down some cement tracks, etc., other family members would see us and join us. We got to a place that looked like a bit of a maze and we saw a guard with a flashlight approaching. We all crouched down as far as we could hoping not to be detected. I was covering Bev. The guard was practically right next to us, shining the flashlight around looking at various things. Sometimes the beam of her flashlight just barely missed us. Bev was now an adult and was sitting further behind me. She had on a dangling bracelet that kept making noise. I heard others behind me giggling. I was getting very upset. The guard was going to hear this. She did and shined her flashlight on us. All of the women in our group offered to give her all of our jewelry if she would just let us go. She agreed. We got to a grassy hill. All we had to do was climb the hill, get through a wire fence and cross the road on the other side of the fence. Then we could disappear into the wooded area there. Actually, I was thinking that once we were off of their property they couldn't do anything, but I didn't want to take any chances. I wanted to get into the woods so they couldn't spot us. Bev was small again now. I raced across the road with her and some other family members followed me. Someone thought we should stay visible to try to get the attention of any of the others if we saw them. I thought one person could be the lookout for the others without being seen, only to stand out and get their attention if they saw them. It would minimize the risk. At the end I wondered if everyone was actually okay, that maybe someone else had been killed in the explosions. [I didn't record all of this because I don't want to.]",

         "I went for my informational interview with Jeff S. After we finished talking he said he was going out for a cup of coffee and asked if I would like to join him. Because I felt this could be an important future business contact I agreed. As we walked down the street, he said he had this special little place that he likes to go. By the looks of the outside of this place I had not even realized it when we arrived there. The entry was dark but there were three white steps leading up to the door. To the left the wall jutted out as far as the bottom step as did the overhead. Now we are in a mini-van type vehicle. Jeff S is driving and I'm sitting in the front passenger sit. There are two people in the back seat. In the seat directly behind me is Jennifer K. I don't know now who the other is. I am turned sideways in my seat, with my legs and feet resting between my seat and Jeff S's. I am talking to the two people in back, but primarily to Jennifer K. Somebody says something that unnerves me. Without thinking I lifted my right hand as if to grab something for support or stability. Jeff S takes my hand. He does so just partially, and cautiously. But I had the sense that this concerned me more than him. I didn't want to give him the wrong impression or do anything inappropriate. It was at this point that I realized he was a single dad. Sometime during all of this we talked about his children, who seemed to be all boys. Something caused me to let go of his hand. I reached to take it again but this time he was holding his hand sideways with his fingers spread apart and my fingers seemed to just naturally go between his. It wasn't until after I did it that I realized what I had done and again felt a bit concerned about impression or inappropriate action. But he just tightened his fingers around mine, just a little, confirming that this was okay. During all of this he never took his eyes off the road, but I don't think I ever looked directly at his face either. I had now let go of his hand as we continued to wherever we were going. I was wearing a skirt that came just above my knees when I sat. As I was talking to the people in back I felt Jeff S's hand slide gently between my knees and lightly caress the inner part of my right knee and just slightly above. Of course I noticed immediately and wasn't sure what to think. He did two or three other similar things, always very subtle, yet noticeable. I reminded myself that he is single and thought that perhaps there was some romantic interest. I thought how nice it would be to be in a relationship with a man like Jeff S. Now Jeff S and I are in this place having coffee and Jennifer K is with us. I don't know what happened to the other person. The weather outside was such that we had coats on, but not necessarily winter coats. It was raining and beginning to get dark. I got the impression that because Jennifer K was with us Jeff S didn't feel he could leave when he wanted. I didn't know if I should say anything to him, to let him know it was fine for him to leave. I had a tote bag with me, with my handbag, portfolio, etc in it. I was looking around for their restrooms. I got the attention of a woman who worked there and she said take me there. She had very pretty, black, shoulder-length hair with lots of volume and wavy curls. I am outside the restroom with Jennifer K. I went in cautiously because there wasn't a full door. The door was more like a stall door in a public restroom, except that it didn't go nearly as high. So passersby could see who was in there. Jennifer K knew I was very uncomfortable with this but had decided I just couldn't wait any longer so she stood in front of the door, facing me, and talking. I noticed a man standing behind her waiting for me to finish. I became concerned, wondering if I was using the men's room or if it was a coed restroom. I did notice a urinal on the wall. As I left I heard a family talking at a nearby table. They were talking about a tote bag that the little boy found and that it was so comfortable. I realized that he had picked mine up and taken it to his table. He had set a stuffed animal on top of it. I just casually went over and picked up my tote and walked away without saying anything. I heard someone at their table tell him that he didn't get to keep it and I somehow knew that the little boy was disappointed. As I returned to the table it occurred to me that possibly Jeff S was hoping Jennifer K would leave so he could talk with me alone again. I suppose he finally gave up and said he needed to get home to his children. He got up from the table and hesitated for a moment then left. A little while later he returned. I don't know if he said told me this or I implied it, but that his children were all tucked in bed for the night so he could leave again. Now I'm in the van with just Jeff S. As we are driving he is expressing his romantic interest in me. He said he wanted very much to kiss me. I was flattered, intrigued, yet wasn't sure how to respond so I simply smiled and said nothing. Later he says the same thing again. Now we are back at the place we were and Jennifer K is there, again or still. There are a bunch of things that we need to load in the back of the van. The van is now Jennifer K 's and it is pretty full of her family's things but we find room for what we need to put in there. The back of the van, from the outside, looks more like an SUV. But from the side it looks like a van. There are several food-serving dishes sitting in the back, with no lids yet partially consumed food in them. I found this curious but said nothing. Jennifer K and Jeff S are both leaving now but Jennifer K is leaving the van for me to drive home. She gave me the keys and said something about the van - like it being temperamental or some such. I tossed the keys in my tote and went back inside alone. I thought I had misplaced the keys once or twice. The place was getting ready to close for the night. I was standing near a back corner that was not well lit. There was a man standing 20 feet or so behind me. Jeff S walks back in and comes straight towards me. He stops just a few feet in front of me. He doesn't say anything, but suddenly leans forward and kisses me. After I got past the surprise of him showing up, and then doing this, I was thinking that he was a really bad kisser. He kept his lips tight together and pursed like a pucker. This was very disappointing. I was trying to make it better but not being successful. He stopped for a moment, said something, and then kissed me again. This time with open mouth. It was a little better, but still not great. He turns and leaves. I am now with him again, and I think there are other people around. We're having a good time, talking and laughing. I notice that his voice is different than I recall. It's not the deep and strong voice I was used to hearing from him. I thought maybe he had a cold. Then I noticed that his teeth, particularly the upper ones, were in very bad condition. The ones that were still there were very irregular, and some very dark. Really bad teeth are always a real turn-off to me. I felt guilty about this because I know it is very superficial. Yet, I have trouble wanting to kiss someone with really bad teeth. I either guessed or he told me that he is the midst of having some significant dental work done and his teeth look like they do because they are in the middle of the process. This made me feel better about thinking about being in a romantic relationship with him, yet I still felt bad because of my attitude towards this. Now I am alone again in the restaurant. All of the other patrons have left and there are two employees still there, closing up. Apparently there had been some kind of spill when Jeff S was there earlier and we had used a towel he had with him to clean it up. Jeff S called my cell phone to tell me it had been left at the restaurant, but it was very important that he get it back. He was guessing that it had been thrown in the trash. He said it had some important information on it. When I got off the phone I asked one of the employees about it. She took me to the back to where the trashcan was. It was a small office-sized wastebasket. Right on top there was a white towel that appeared to have spaghetti sauce all over it, or something like it. I gingerly picked it up so as not to get anything on me. Moving it around with my hand I looked at it to see if it was the right one. I told the employee that it wasn't. Then I noticed another one in the wastebasket. Again, a white towel with something that looked like spaghetti sauce all over it. As I bent down to pick it up I noticed the row after row of typed information on it. I said that this is the one. I picked it up and turned to leave. I went outside to the van. I seemed to behind the building, with the back of another building across the parking lot. There were only one or two other cars in the parking lot, and the van was parked furthest away. I was a bit nervous about walking alone to the van at this time of night. When I got to the van I realized that it had been broken into and someone had stolen some of the things that we had put in it earlier. That bothered me of course, but I was most bothered because Jennifer K had lent me her van and now some of her family things had been taken as well. I thought it was odd that they had taken some of the food-serving dishes. The two employees came out of the door Jeff S and I had entered originally. One came down the steps while the other locked the door. Then she same down the steps. She saw me by the van and said something to me. I told her about the things being stolen. As we talked another woman walked up. She was a maintenance worker of some kind. She said she threw the things away because she thought they were supposed to be. I was very upset yet trying not to show it, as I didn't want to hurt or upset her if it was an honest mistake. I quickly started looking around, thinking I could just retrieve the things from the trash. I asked where she had disposed of them. She pointed towards the building and said she had thrown them over there, in the river. Now I was simply flabbergasted. I was thinking, what? Why would she do that? Why would she dispose of things she thought was trash in a river? However, while I was thinking this I was looking towards where she was pointing and not seeing a river by any means. I thought that was crazy. There wouldn't be a river running alongside a building, and there wasn't enough room between these two buildings for there to be a river anyway. As I squinted and tried to focus my eyes to see better in the darkness, I noticed a small gully cut into the cement along the building. Water was flowing out of an opening through this gully. The gully went 20 - 30 feet or so and then there was a sharp right angle and it continued. I think a little further down there was a sharp left angle where it continued. As soon as I noticed it I ran over there hoping that I might be able to retrieve the things. I saw nothing and realized it had been too long since she disposed of it and it had all been washed away.",

         "Interpret this dream: I went for my informational interview with Jeff S. After we finished talking he said he was going out for a cup of coffee and asked if I would like to join him.

         "This dream, as I recall it, begins earlier, but I remember it begins at a very elite party, very uppercrust, and for what reason, I have no idea, but I'm there. I believe everyone is dressed in tuxedos and evening gowns, and the instant that I clearly remember began when a most complex piece of design that was decorating the place is some way centrally involved with the activity of the evening, made out of cardboard or silvered (antepaper?) became disarrayed, and I think it was supposed to be my fault or something, but at any rate, I attempted to strike it out. The next thing I remember I was in a hallway and two women were helping me straighten it out, either one was on an end of it and that made them approximately 12 ft. away from one another, and I was underneath trying to straighten this rather complex design. I would sort of crawl on the floor from one to the other, trying to straighten it out because it seemed to be the only way. I became somewhat enamoured with one of the women, even though both of their skirts were rather tight around their knees, the one that I thought was also slightly interested in me, I may have kissed her on the calf and I believe she liked it and sort of presented her other calf to be kissed, which I think I did. Then just out of sheer devilishness, I crept back, fixing the design and kissed the other one on the calf, which didn't go over too big. As a matter of fact, I was quite certain that she was shocked and was possibly indignant about it, but I just chuckled to myself and continued about my work. The rather curvaceous and attractive woman at the other end was moving about and I caressed her legs again and put my hands on and then finally I think I got this complex design straightened out. Then I had taken it in my hands away from the ladies and there were finger holes up and down the center of it, from one end to the other, so that grabbed a certain way, it would open up into a certain kind of a design. I just grabbed and pulled it a certain way, but then the other woman who became indignant at my behavior said, \"I'm going to inform my husband about this, \" and the other woman and I, looking at one another sort of laughingly, and I said to her, mocking the behavior of the indignant woman, \"But c'estime moi?\" and she corrected it and said, \"No, it's not _____, it's (certain moi)\" or something like that. At any rate, she corrected my pronunciation smilingly. It was a rather inviting smile. She was very -- well, they were both projecting a very sensual interest in one another. As we continued to walk down this corridor, we came into a living room, sort of, and this woman was walking back, the indignant one, and the lady who I was with separated from me for a moment, and the indignant woman informed me that she had informed her husband of the unpleasant incident. Well, her husband didn't know me by looking at me. She just informed him of my name and at any rate as I walked by her, I realized her husband was an old man and he was sitting with a rather matronly woman. Now the picture becomes rather complicated. I happened to overhear his conversation with this woman and he is expressing to her that he, in very subtle ways, that he admires her, her attractiveness, and the conversation goes on in this vein. And she asks him, \"What about your wife?\" and he makes some kind of comment, I don't know, something like, \"country widow,\" something like this, somehow implying that she's not with him and she's not anywhere around. She's in the country, or something like this. I think that was the phrase he used, something like golf widow, but he didn't use that phrase. By some deceptive scheme, I had prearranged it so that his wife was there. I don't know where I did this. It's not yet completely clear. It involved a friend of mine, whom I believe I somehow manipulated to appear as myself. A funny thing took place with the conversation of all of us, was in a very British accent. It was almost like a comedy of Shaw, although I dare say my dreams are not quite that good. At any rate, well, this other woman with whom I was rather beginning to become enamoured and interested, I gave her a pat on the rear end and said, \"Now you take this tray of glasses and go in there and offer so and so a drink or something,\" and some way this was a feint, a manner of throwing this man's wife off guard, thinking that somehow things weren't as she thought. It was very complicated. I can't quite figure it out. At any rate, the upshot of the whole thing was that his wife observed him in this rather intimate conversation with the woman he was sitting next to. In other words, the old fat fuddy duddy he was, he was making a play for her and this struck myself and my new-found friend rather amusingly and we both had chuckled to ourselves as the man's wife stomped off in another direction, again rather indignantly. In the earlier part of this dream, there was something taking place in an auditorium, I believe, and it's just that I don't remember too much about the design, but as I say, it was extremely intricate. It was longitudinal and it had at one time been a solid piece of material which had been extremely carefully cut so that it opened into a very complex design, very symmetrical, and as I said, there were these finger holes down the left of it so that by placing one's finger in them, they're labeled which finger went where on the back of it, and how it was to be pulled so that the design came out. At the time it seemed like to get this design back together was a very crucial thing to the affair that was going on. Although in what way, I really am not sure. I had the feeling that self, well, that I was playing a role almost like an actor, and everything was going off according to the cue and the performance was just perfect. The whole dream had a tone of being a very farcical comedy in the old traditions, so to speak, a British comedy, with as I said, sexual overtones. I was just delighted with the whole thing. The old man whose wife I had infuriated was sitting at a very large, dark mahogany table with this woman whom he was making a play for, who was wearing a very low cut evening gown. She was rather fat, though, I won't say, well yes, sort of heavy and so was he. They both were stereotype sort of characters. He a fat old man, rich with a bald head and white hair, and he had a self-delusive quality of __________ as he was making it, so to speak, with this woman. She was something like the grande dame, completely bejeweled. Her rather large breasts were apparent at the top of the evening gown. I don't recall much conversation on her part. I got the impression that she was enjoying the whole thing, whereas the man's wife whose calf I kissed was really an attractive woman, but was somewhat, well, her attitude toward herself was that of an older woman. She dressed in a very severe and what I would say moralistic way, her makeup and her hair drawn back packed tightly into a bun, black dress. The women who I really dug was quite curvaceous and radiated sensual warmth toward me. This friend of mine in the earlier part of the dream was, that is the one that was serving as a dupe for me to get out of this fix I was in with this woman's husband, the one I instructed my new-found friend to go in with this tray of glasses and offer him a drink, that was a tray of cocktails or something and at the same time embraced him so as to indicate seemingly, yes, that's right, that she was completely interested in him and somehow thereby indicating that I was interested in this man's wife, that is the wife whom I had insulted. This was done in such a manner that this woman's husband would observe my friend, my male and female friends. It seems that at one point, before we got into the hallway with this fancy design to be straightened out, it was somehow carried up to the back of the auditorium, that is the entrance to it, the top of one of the aisles was a group of people there trying to straighten it out. And I was more or less trying to straighten it out too, and everyone was yelling at everybody else, \"Here's how to do it. This is the way to do it.\" Everybody was trying to fix it at once. Apparently _____________ it had gotten dragged off into this hallway, I'm not sure how. I keep referring to this thing. It's really not that big and yet it seemingly has changed dimensions a couple of times. It's a very heavy paper like that you would find on milk cartons. The one side of it is silver, a cover with aluminum foil. The edges are scalloped, very small scallops. The nature of the design is reminiscent of the top of the, no, it's like a design I've seen upon occasion in this little window. It's done just the same way. The whole design is made out of one piece of paper, but when you collapse it, you can see by the way it was carefully cut, it can open up into this design. Day residue: This design reminds me of the top of the box of popcorn which the article appeared in its own aluminum box, and all you have to do is put on heat on the stove and it will pop. But the top of it is wrapped in such a way that it forms a design and as it pops, it unfolds and billows out. It's a design sort of thing, and the color is aluminum. The female which I became interested in is somewhat reminiscent of a girl I once knew by name practically, had seen her only once, but who later thorough a series of unusual circumstances, came to be a bunny at the Playboy Club, and she is very curvaceous and attractive, though she is not possessed of the more benign sort of personality that the woman in the dream had. I do plan on going to the Playboy Club this evening, and as a matter of fact, the place in which I intend to go there is the living room. One of the big scenes in this dream took place in what appeared to be a living room, having several levels to it, small levels, 3 steps up to one. The idea of an auditorium might also be associated with the Playboy Club since they have many rooms in which they have entertainment of all sorts and present it in all different ways. One particularly sensual element in the dream, I just remembered, was when these women were holding the design, and I was underneath trying to straighten it out, the woman I liked moved around to the side -- this is after I kissed her on the leg -- and she spread her legs apart, not very far because her skirt was tight, but she knew I was right there. It didn't really strike me at all as a gross gesture. It rather warmed me all the more. One additional bit of day residue is that one occasion Gilda and I, how we did I don't know, but for some reason we started talking to one another in a phony British accent and we were kidding one another with this, and this seemed to come in very big in this dream.",

         "Interpret this dream: This dream, as I recall it, begins earlier, but I remember it begins at a very elite party, very uppercrust, and for what reason, I have no idea, but I'm there. I believe everyone is dressed in tuxedos and evening gowns, and the instant that I clearly remember began when a most complex piece of design that was decorating the place is some way centrally involved with the activity of the evening, made out of cardboard or silvered (antepaper?) became disarrayed, and I think it was supposed to be my fault or something, but at any rate, I attempted to strike it out. The next thing I remember I was in a hallway and two women were helping me straighten it out, either one was on an end of it and that made them approximately 12 ft. away from one another, and I was underneath trying to straighten this rather complex design. I would sort of crawl on the floor from one to the other, trying to straighten it out because it seemed to be the only way. I became somewhat enamoured with one of the women, even though both of their skirts were rather tight around their knees, the one that I thought was also slightly interested in me, I may have kissed her on the calf and I believe she liked it and sort of presented her other calf to be kissed, which I think I did. Then just out of sheer devilishness, I crept back, fixing the design and kissed the other one on the calf, which didn't go over too big. As a matter of fact, I was quite certain that she was shocked and was possibly indignant about it, but I just chuckled to myself and continued about my work. The rather curvaceous and attractive woman at the other end was moving about and I caressed her legs again and put my hands on and then finally I think I got this complex design straightened out. Then I had taken it in my hands away from the ladies and there were finger holes up and down the center of it, from one end to the other, so that grabbed a certain way, it would open up into a certain kind of a design. I just grabbed and pulled it a certain way, but then the other woman who became indignant at my behavior said, \"I'm going to inform my husband about this, \" and the other woman and I, looking at one another sort of laughingly, and I said to her, mocking the behavior of the indignant woman, \"But c'estime moi?\" and she corrected it and said, \"No, it's not _____, it's (certain moi)\" or something like that. At any rate, she corrected my pronunciation smilingly. It was a rather inviting smile. She was very -- well, they were both projecting a very sensual interest in one another. As we continued to walk down this corridor, we came into a living room, sort of, and this woman was walking back, the indignant one, and the lady who I was with separated from me for a moment, and the indignant woman informed me that she had informed her husband of the unpleasant incident. Well, her husband didn't know me by looking at me. She just informed him of my name and at any rate as I walked by her, I realized her husband was an old man and he was sitting with a rather matronly woman. Now the picture becomes rather complicated. I happened to overhear his conversation with this woman and he is expressing to her that he, in very subtle ways, that he admires her, her attractiveness, and the conversation goes on in this vein. And she asks him, \"What about your wife?\" and he makes some kind of comment, I don't know, something like, \"country widow,\" something like this, somehow implying that she's not with him and she's not anywhere around. She's in the country, or something like this. I think that was the phrase he used, something like golf widow, but he didn't use that phrase. By some deceptive scheme, I had prearranged it so that his wife was there. I don't know where I did this. It's not yet completely clear. It involved a friend of mine, whom I believe I somehow manipulated to appear as myself. A funny thing took place with the conversation of all of us, was in a very British accent. It was almost like a comedy of Shaw, although I dare say my dreams are not quite that good. At any rate, well, this other woman with whom I was rather beginning to become enamoured and interested, I gave her a pat on the rear end and said, \"Now you take this tray of glasses and go in there and offer so and so a drink or something,\" and some way this was a feint, a manner of throwing this man's wife off guard, thinking that somehow things weren't as she thought. It was very complicated. I can't quite figure it out. At any rate, the upshot of the whole thing was that his wife observed him in this rather intimate conversation with the woman he was sitting next to. In other words, the old fat fuddy duddy he was, he was making a play for her and this struck myself and my new-found friend rather amusingly and we both had chuckled to ourselves as the man's wife stomped off in another direction, again rather indignantly. In the earlier part of this dream, there was something taking place in an auditorium, I believe, and it's just that I don't remember too much about the design, but as I say, it was extremely intricate. It was longitudinal and it had at one time been a solid piece of material which had been extremely carefully cut so that it opened into a very complex design, very symmetrical, and as I said, there were these finger holes down the left of it so that by placing one's finger in them, they're labeled which finger went where on the back of it, and how it was to be pulled so that the design came out. At the time it seemed like to get this design back together was a very crucial thing to the affair that was going on. Although in what way, I really am not sure. I had the feeling that self, well, that I was playing a role almost like an actor, and everything was going off according to the cue and the performance was just perfect. The whole dream had a tone of being a very farcical comedy in the old traditions, so to speak, a British comedy, with as I said, sexual overtones. I was just delighted with the whole thing. The old man whose wife I had infuriated was sitting at a very large, dark mahogany table with this woman whom he was making a play for, who was wearing a very low cut evening gown. She was rather fat, though, I won't say, well yes, sort of heavy and so was he. They both were stereotype sort of characters. He a fat old man, rich with a bald head and white hair, and he had a self-delusive quality of __________ as he was making it, so to speak, with this woman. She was something like the grande dame, completely bejeweled. Her rather large breasts were apparent at the top of the evening gown. I don't recall much conversation on her part. I got the impression that she was enjoying the whole thing, whereas the man's wife whose calf I kissed was really an attractive woman, but was somewhat, well, her attitude toward herself was that of an older woman. She dressed in a very severe and what I would say moralistic way, her makeup and her hair drawn back packed tightly into a bun, black dress. The women who I really dug was quite curvaceous and radiated sensual warmth toward me. This friend of mine in the earlier part of the dream was, that is the one that was serving as a dupe for me to get out of this fix I was in with this woman's husband, the one I instructed my new-found friend to go in with this tray of glasses and offer him a drink, that was a tray of cocktails or something and at the same time embraced him so as to indicate seemingly, yes, that's right, that she was completely interested in him and somehow thereby indicating that I was interested in this man's wife, that is the wife whom I had insulted. This was done in such a manner that this woman's husband would observe my friend, my male and female friends. It seems that at one point, before we got into the hallway with this fancy design to be straightened out, it was somehow carried up to the back of the auditorium, that is the entrance to it, the top of one of the aisles was a group of people there trying to straighten it out. And I was more or less trying to straighten it out too, and everyone was yelling at everybody else, \"Here's how to do it. This is the way to do it.\" Everybody was trying to fix it at once. Apparently _____________ it had gotten dragged off into this hallway, I'm not sure how. I keep referring to this thing. It's really not that big and yet it seemingly has changed dimensions a couple of times. It's a very heavy paper like that you would find on milk cartons. The one side of it is silver, a cover with aluminum foil. The edges are scalloped, very small scallops. The nature of the design is reminiscent of the top of the, no, it's like a design I've seen upon occasion in this little window. It's done just the same way. The whole design is made out of one piece of paper, but when you collapse it, you can see by the way it was carefully cut, it can open up into this design.

         "I'm coming up to a sort of rocky ledge with a low (natural?) wall - all around there's sky, huge and beautiful. There's a mountain range in the distance. The colors are all yellowish and there's a sort of early-morning feel. It's not warm, but it's not real cold either. Somehow I know this either is Tibet, or we're coming to it. Down beneath the wall are a couple of flowers growing. They're very sturdy, thick-leafed, the kind of petals that start out green first, and shaped something like hyacinths. I think I'll eat one but I see it isn't fully developed yet. There's another, though, with a wider shape to it and quite thick (you might say meaty) rather than made up of lightweight petals, and I pull that and take bites of it. As I do (it doesn't really have much taste, by the way, but it's substantial) I find that buried in it is a small saucerlike bit of pottery, standard white-glazed with a flower pattern round the edge, much like diner dishes - I pull it out and see that it's the foot of a sort of vase or stemmed dish we'd found around here shortly before and we'd wondered where the foot was. It seems that the flower just grew around it. We go on. Soon we get to civilization of a sort. We're in a stairwell of a building I can tell is massive, and the scene is mostly dark, as if it were night, and we were seeing outside through windows, but we're not - on the left (facing down the stairwell) is a huge wall, and it shows a magnificent scene [although right now I can't remember what of, or even what it looked like - it may have even been an outdoor landscape, as if there were a window there. I halfway think the wall in front, on the stairwell, was indeed a window. But I'm not sure.] To the right is an open door into a lighted room, and people - not in large numbers - keep moving up and down the stairs and into and out of the room. They're all Orientals, these people, dressed in native clothes, the long coats, the hats with round stand-up brims, the slipper shoes. I'm aware that this place is equivalent in some respects to a shopping mall - of course, plain and simple, it is one, it has lots of vendors selling things that people want and need, all under one roof; but there's some fundamental difference in it, too. These people are taking the thing more seriously, for one thing. And it isn't set up intentionally for fun - though there are some neat things about it. The left-hand wall, for instance: at first I thought I was looking at (something, whatever it was!) really magnificent and elaborate. But now something has shifted - either it's done this on purpose, or my viewpoint has changed, but I see now that the whole thing is painted, an illusion. A bloody good illusion, but nevertheless not what I thought it was. Now that I know that, it bothers me - the whole situation bothers me. I'm not sure what to do next. At the same time, what's occupying my mind is the observation of this \"shopping-mall\" business. The idea of the mall is sort of \"new\" to us here, but when you think about it, there's nothing unusual about it except that we started building malls in places where there were already plenty of stores to be found. Elsewhere, stores are still grouped collectively for the convenience of the shoppers, but they have to come from farther away and do more business at a time. That's why there were fairs and street markets. It wouldn't be any sillier to build a regular mall in Tibet than in Texas, for heaven's sake. If people want to buy things, why wouldn't they do it in a mall just as easily as from rickety booths on the street? I'm on a city bus with several people from yoga class - I guess we've just left a class - including George and maybe Cynthia. I've got my purse and something else with me, which I stow on the seat. This is [another] \"funny\" bus - has its seats placed differently from regular buses, and it's up high like the out-of-town-coaches. We're all in a pretty fun mood, and we bowl along through a pretty part of town, with big trees and nice streets, older houses and occasional stores and offices. At one point the bus is diverted by road works from its regular route, and we turn to the left. Then, because of the diversion, we have to drive through a building - actually it's a lot like the Central area Pharmacy except it's got a garage attached. There's 2 sections to it. You can pull in the front or the back - the front is a bit more finished, with matching red brick to the store - you can enter the store from there. The back is different, with painted walls, a little more garage-like. The bus stops in the front; it's going to wait there to catch up to its schedule, and we all pile out of it to stretch our legs and look around. This is a place we know anyway, but it's neat. There's a sort of art exhibit in the back section, various things stuck up on the wall as if a children's school class had done them. Sue S is here (suddenly - I don't remember her being on the bus) and she's looking at them with us. And Tree is here, too - this place is only a short distance from where I live - on the street in back, matter of fact - and he's been exploring down here, I guess. He's come in the back door (both are open), and I pick him up and show him to the people. Actually I'm surprised he's letting me do that, and I'm keeping a good strong grip because he's beginning to get twitchy - but Sue and some others say, oh, what a pretty kitty, and I make up my mind to just go on home with him from here since we're so close, without waiting for the bus. I have to go back in to get my stuff, though. [And I suppose I put Tree down because he wasn't with me for the next part.] I climb up and go to get my purse and things, but while I'm here the bus starts to move. I guess it must have been left in gear or something because it starts going right on out and across the street (the entrance faces another street), and carries on for a couple of blocks. It stops eventually because it runs up against something, I guess, but it's a bit precarious. I can see that the street is going a bit downhill and if it starts to roll again it'll be hard to stop. I get out very carefully and go around to the front, thinking I might push it backward off of the incline, if I can (it's not such a big bus at the moment, you see - it seems like a possibility). But it's just barely starting to move again, and I give it a push, but no go - oh dear. I leap out of the way and remember I still haven't got my things, so I jump back on. The bus gathers momentum and rolls onward, down a street and around a curve and finally comes to rest somewhere, no particular damage done. I am joined now by a little guy in a rather exotic outfit - he's not quite midget-sized, but definitely well below average. (Rather good-looking though - dressed up sort of like, you might say, a warrior-elf. Maybe that's what he is. He's got on some sort of blue loincloth affair, and boots - dark hair, not too long - looks tough but still cute.) (I don't know where he comes from, but I'm not shocked to find him there - maybe he was hiding inside or something - I'm sure he didn't come in from outside.) We discuss the situation, which is more involved than it looks - we need to contact somebody for help. We can't handle this bus on our own (it's become something more like a spaceship now, and much larger), we know there's normally a crew of 2 men to run it, and we can't just leave it where it is and go. (I don't know why.) We poke around some, and find the radio to call the central-whatever with, and send a message to send help. That done, we banter around some more - this all seems like a rather fun adventure - and sort of get cozy. He proposes having sex, right there in the cabin, and I think it sounds like something of a lark, and say yes - I've never had sex with an elf before, for sure, and it might be very different, who knows? We've got nothing better to do till the rescue party gets here, although we don't know when that'll be. [Actually a fair amount of time has passed already.] Suddenly, as he moves over me lying on the floor, he gets bigger - much bigger. He sort of stretches out till he looms over me, and I don't like it. I say so, and next he reaches beyond me over my head to a shelf where he's put something to be handy. It's a kind of face-mask, only it's made of beads (not fine little round beads but cylindrical mostly, they're white and red, maybe orange and yellow too) and it fits over his chin loosely, like a beard. The look on his face has gone very serious, the way you do when the playful part of sex gives way to the other feelings. At that moment, the \"crew\" sent out from the central office arrives. We break apart in a hurry, as you might imagine, and explain who we are, and what happened. There are 2 men and a woman, they look very cold and matter-of-fact, but ask us to help (by doing something, but I don't remember what - it involves looking around the \"ship\"). I go \"downstairs\" - toward the front of the place we're in - you might call it a cockpit - it no longer looks like a bus, there's a wall behind, very \"ship\"-like - there are stairs, or a ladder to the next level. I hadn't even realized this was here. There's a bathroom down here, good, I need one, and go across the room towards it, but a man goes into it before me, so I have to wait. Now I'm confused. Who is this guy, and how did he get here before me? Is he one of the Tree that just arrived, and got here by another stair? Or has he been down here the whole time? If so, why didn't he say anything? Is he hiding? Oh, well, I'll just wait.",

The bus gathers momentum and rolls onward, down a street and around a curve and finally comes to rest somewhere, no particular damage done. I am joined now by a little guy in a rather exotic outfit - he's not quite midget-sized, but definitely well below average. (Rather good-looking though - dressed up sort of like, you might say, a warrior-elf. Maybe that's what he is. He's got on some sort of blue loincloth affair, and boots - dark hair, not too long - looks tough but still cute.) (I don't know where he comes from, but I'm not shocked to find him there - maybe he was hiding inside or something - I'm sure he didn't come in from outside.) We discuss the situation, which is more involved than it looks - we need to contact somebody for help. We can't handle this bus on our own (it's become something more like a spaceship now, and much larger), we know there's normally a crew of 2 men to run it, and we can't just leave it where it is and go. (I don't know why.) We poke around some, and find the radio to call the central-whatever with, and send a message to send help. That done, we banter around some more - this all seems like a rather fun adventure - and sort of get cozy. He proposes having sex, right there in the cabin, and I think it sounds like something of a lark, and say yes - I've never had sex with an elf before, for sure, and it might be very different, who knows? We've got nothing better to do till the rescue party gets here, although we don't know when that'll be. [Actually a fair amount of time has passed already.] Suddenly, as he moves over me lying on the floor, he gets bigger - much bigger. He sort of stretches out till he looms over me, and I don't like it. I say so, and next he reaches beyond me over my head to a shelf where he's put something to be handy. It's a kind of face-mask, only it's made of beads (not fine little round beads but cylindrical mostly, they're white and red, maybe orange and yellow too) and it fits over his chin loosely, like a beard. The look on his face has gone very serious, the way you do when the playful part of sex gives way to the other feelings. At that moment, the \"crew\" sent out from the central office arrives. We break apart in a hurry, as you might imagine, and explain who we are, and what happened. There are 2 men and a woman, they look very cold and matter-of-fact, but ask us to help (by doing something, but I don't remember what - it involves looking around the \"ship\"). I go \"downstairs\" - toward the front of the place we're in - you might call it a cockpit - it no longer looks like a bus, there's a wall behind, very \"ship\"-like - there are stairs, or a ladder to the next level. I hadn't even realized this was here. There's a bathroom down here, good, I need one, and go across the room towards it, but a man goes into it before me, so I have to wait. Now I'm confused. Who is this guy, and how did he get here before me? Is he one of the Tree that just arrived, and got here by another stair? Or has he been down here the whole time? If so, why didn't he say anything? Is he hiding? Oh, well, I'll just wait.\nSymbols: - Garden: To see a sparse, weed-infested garden suggests that you have neglected your spiritual needs. You are not on top of things.\n - Garden: Dreaming of a tropical garden implies that you are seeking warmth and comfort.\n - Great Wall of China: To see or dream that you are at the Great Wall of China refers to your ability to shut some people out, while letting others through. You are careful with who you let into your life.\n - Flower: To see colorful flowers in your dream signify kindness, compassion, gentleness, pleasure, beauty, and gain. It is also symbolic of perfection and spirituality. Your dream may be an expression of love, joy and happiness. Alternatively, flowers in dream, especially if they are blooming, represent your hidden potential and latent talents. Flowers can also denote a particular time or season. If the flowers are white, then it symbolizes sadness. Consider the color of the flower and the type of flower for additional analysis.\n - Flower: To see withered or dead flowers in your dream denotes disappointments and gloomy situations. It may signal an end to a love relationship. Or it could indicate that you may not be utilizing your full potential and talents and letting it go to waste.",

         "I had driven my car somewhere and ran into some kind of problem and had to walk home. I think I may have walked home to get my car key. I wasn't sure I knew the way back so I just trusted my intuition. I entered a door on a building that seemed to be in a bit of disrepair. It led me through a long somewhat dark hallway. At the other end was another door. When I exited that door I realized that I had just walked through one of the front buildings of my apartment complex and was now in the very front of the complex. I turned to my left, walked to the corner, and then turned to my left again, onto the sidewalk along the main entrance. Shortly after I turned the corner I realized I didn't have my house key. I kept walking as I tried to figure out what to do. It was a time of day when the office wasn't open and maintenance wasn't around so I couldn't go ask them to let me in. I needed a phone and didn't have my cell phone with me and I really needed to use the bathroom. I thought about walking to a public place like a store or gas station but didn't want to walk that far because I really had to go to the bathroom and I was barefoot. I had left my gym shoes in the car. I finally decided to just knock on someone's door and see if they would let me use their phone. I could call the maintenance emergency number and they could come and let me in. A woman answered the door. A very pleasant, white woman. She invited me and began chatting. She seemed to welcome an opportunity to make a new friend, especially in the neighborhood. She said she would just take me to my car. At that point that seemed to be what I needed so I was very grateful. I interrupted her, apologized for doing so, and then told her I needed very badly to use the bathroom and would she mind if I used hers. She said of course not and pointed me toward it. When I finished I flushed it and watched the water rise to the very edge of the top. I wasn't sure whether I should take the tank lid off to stop it and prevent it from possibly overflowing, since I know how to do that, or if I should just do nothing. I decided to do nothing as it seemed to stop rising. I am now asleep in what I think is my own bed. I've been sleeping for some time and wake up very groggy. I stumble to the bathroom attached to the bedroom. After using the toilet, I wake up a bit more and wonder why the d_cor of the room seems so different. The walls and shower curtain have a white, blue, and brown pattern of vertical stripes with flowers randomly throughout. I walk back into the bedroom. I was completely undressed and wanted to put something on so I reach for a t-shirt that is lying on the bed. I suddenly realize I am in someone else's house and I don't even know who it is. As I am quickly trying to pull the t-shirt on I see the blankets move and realize that there is even someone else in the bed. I crouch down to the floor to try to hide but still be able to see who is in the bed. It turns out to be a teenage girl. She notices me and sits upright in bed and looks like she is about to scream. I quickly put my finger to my mouth and whisper, shhh. Please don't say anything. I said something else but I don't know what so she didn't make a sound. Then I told her that I didn't know how I got there or why. I told her I needed help with my car. She quickly got up and pushed her bedroom door closed but not all the way. She said her parents would be very upset if they knew I was there. I don't know if she meant angry or frightened. I told her I would try to leave without them seeing me. Her parents call her so she leaves the room. I'm afraid of who might come in so I try to get into a very small closet. It's hardly deep enough for me to stand with my back to the wall and close the door. When I first open the closet door it is packed with clothes and I'm afraid I won't be able to get in. It's not much wider than I am shoulder-to-shoulder. Once I got in there were only a few clothes on hangers and one very large thing that reminds me of a cushion for an outdoor chaise lounge and the closet door is only partially on its hinges. When I try to close it I can still see into the bedroom in several places. There are now quite a few people out there. It looks like a sitting room, with sofa and chairs. There is a young boy sitting on the sofa facing the closet. I can tell that he sees me and is getting ready to say something to the others. The girl comes back in and starts to tell them about me. I come out of the closet. They don't seem afraid, just surprised and/or curious. I explain as best I can what happened and that I just need a ride to my car. The girl has a teenage brother who is there and one of his friends is there. They say they will be glad to take me to my car. You can see the mischievous look in their eyes, as I am standing there with a t-shirt on and nothing else. The dad and the grandpa say they will go also, in case I need help with the car. I wish I had some more clothes to put on but there is almost nothing in the girl's closet. I ask her brother if I can borrow a pair of his pajama paints and a shirt. He and his friend kind of look around and mumble something as if they're trying to decide if they have anything that I can wear. As the dad and grandpa are ready to leave the friend decides he can't go because he has somewhere else he needs to be and then the brother decides he has homework to do so he isn't going either. The dad and grandpa try to change the brother's mind but are not successful. As we're leaving I tell them that I'm not exactly sure where the car is but I know it's somewhere within a few block radius. I didn't know the name of the street that I left it on, then or now, and told them I wasn't sure how to get back home from there when I started walking. As we're walking to get to my car there is a lot of roadwork or some such going on. We have to walk across some wood plank bridges and things similar to that. When we're crossing one of them I realize that I knew that stream was there in our neighborhood. They were a couple of times when we had to stretch our legs to get from the bridge back onto the grass. I learn that these men work in the fishing industry. We walk by a place where a lot of their coworkers are working. They are told that they are really needed right now. They tell me it won't take long and I can't wait for them. There are maybe 20 men standing in this container that looks like an orange commercial dumpster. The top edge of the dumpster is just a bit taller than the tallest men in it. A bunch of seals are about to be released into this container and all of these men need to be standing in there when they do it for the safety of the seals, though it's not to catch them or help them in. They all stand with their backs to the side where the seals are to be released into the container. This is a very dangerous part of their job. Some men have lost their lives doing this. They all realize it is a risk of their job. I am very concerned for all of them. I hate to see people having to do things that they know could cost them their life. I'm especially concerned here, though, because this dad and grandpa are going in. I wonder if their family knows about this or should be told that they are getting ready to help with this. Now the container is almost twice as deep as it was. The dad seems to be near the surface and the grandpa near the bottom. The dad asks him to change places with him because, apparently, the bottom is much more dangerous. Grandpa is standing next to some kind of mechanism that needs to be operated as the seals are released. He tells the dad no, that he needs to operate this mechanism and implies that he has lived his life and would rather he be the one to die if anyone is going to. The seals are released and are falling into the container from what looks like a waterfall stream of water coming from the transport vehicle. I head back to their house to tell the woman what is going on. I'm not sure why, but now I know that her name is Connie B. Another woman is there talking with her. The three of us are talking. This other woman says a couple of things that I don't understand, using terms or phrases that I'm not familiar with, yet it still sounds very crude, or crass, and ill-mannered. After she leaves Connie B begins talking about her and how she talks. She repeats one thing that she says and looks at me in disbelief as she asks me if I can believe she even said that. I'm just sitting there silent because I don't know what it meant. Connie B asks me if I know what it is and I shake my head no. I'm thinking that I'm not sure I even want to know, but she tells me anyway. It has something to do with bowel movements. I agree that it was very crass and unpleasant talk. I want to get my own clothes on and go home. Dad and grandpa are back and tell me that Connie B had put my clothes in the bathroom. I went in and closed the door. I wanted to use the toilet before I got dressed but saw out of the corner of my eye that there was something in it. I reached to flush it. Just as I did I realized they had put my clothes somewhere so that they had been partially hanging in the toilet. That's what I had seen out of the corner of my eye. I quickly grabbed them so the toilet wouldn't have a chance of trying to suck them down and getting clogged up or creating a problem or anything. Now I'm frustrated because I wanted to get dressed but my clothes are wet. I decide that they aren't that wet and I really want to go home so I'm just going to put them on anyway, the way they are.",

The jet appeared to be on a collision course with the dirigible, which was motionless, but it was fairly obvious that this was an optical illusion because they were simply in my line of sight but the dirigible was farther away.  One or the other began descending rapidly -- too rapidly and at too steep an angle, it seemed to me -- toward the airport.

I have a room upstairs and take the elevator. I push the wrong button and the elevator goes down first, then takes me up to my room. I remember getting the key and going in saying to Pedro: \"I'll meet you later.\" Frank is in the room, eating. I worry about him being there, eating without paying, but the portions are so large I can share them with him. I return the dirty dishes all wrapped in white paper.... No one seems to worry about Frank. I get ready to go on a hike with the others. I put on my knee highs, my new tennis shoes and go out on the green lawn where Pedro is waiting. (happy feeling)",

Therefore, we began to criticize them, until one of them picked a fight with me and we started to hit each other, until after a long effort I was able to defeat him. That's all.\nSymbols: - Gang: To dream that you are confronted or threatened by a gang signifies circumstances or situations in your waking life that are becoming overwhelming. You feel that you are being \"ganged\" up on.\n - Affliction: To dream others afflicted in your dream denotes that you will find yourself surrounded by grief and misfortune.\n - Assault: To dream that you have been assaulted refers to a waking situation where you feel vulnerable or helpless. Something in your life is out of your control. In particular, if you dream of being sexually assaulted, then it refers to a situation where you feel violated or victimized. If you have been assaulted in real life, then such dreams may also be a flashback to the actual assault.\n - Attack: To dream that you are being attacked by someone indicates your character is being questioned. You feel the need to defend yourself. You are feeling stressed, vulnerable and helpless. You may also be facing difficult changes in your waking life. Dreaming of an attack provides a way for you to confront these situations that you may be avoiding in real life.\n - Homosexual: Dreaming that you are in a relationship with someone who is homosexual in real life implies that you are looking for specific qualities as represented by this person. Alternatively, being in a relationship with a homosexual person means that you are looking for something unattainable in your current relationship.",

They are monitoring his work so that when he dies his legacy will be intact and will be passed on to them. However, some other people come and ask him to sign over his works to them. He does so and then goes back to work.  His family is deeply upset and hurt. I try to explain to them. I say, He loves you but his first love is his work. You don't matter, in the long run. They have hurt feelings.\nSymbols: - Brother: To dream that you are mad or angry at your brother signifies repressed anger that you are feeling but afraid to express in your waking life.\n - Grandfather: If your grandfather is dead and you dream that he is alive, then it may just mean that you miss them and are trying to relive the time you spent with them when he was alive. If you dream that your grandfather is doing odd things, then it implies that you are still trying to understand his death. Perhaps you haven't come to terms with why he passed away.\n - Father: To dream that your father is angry at you indicates that you are doing something that he may disapprove. The dream may also be a projection of your own anger towards him. There are some unresolved issues that need to be worked out.\n - Cousin: To dream that you or your sibling is in love with a cousin represents your acceptance of each other. You are acknowledging and embracing key qualities in one another.\n - Death: If a love one has past away, but you dream that he or she didn't really die that first time and are being buried again indicates that this loved one was taken before their time and you never got a chance to say a proper good bye. Perhaps there was some unfinished issue that is still left lingering long after their death. You wished you had a little more time with them.",

My neck was sore and Ms Solomon told me to rub this bit of my neck, so I did and eventually it cracked and felt good. I think we were doing the English exam. Jeremiah was next to me and a yellow hat was in the way. Mom worked at McDonald's. There was a really cheesy burger. The shop was set up strangely and it was hard to wash up. There was weird soap.

Ask yourself what makes this person special or what you like about them. It is that very quality that you are lacking in your own relationship or circumstances. Alternatively, the dream indicates that whatever that person represents has no part in your own life anymore. In particular, to dream about the death of your living parents indicates that you are undergoing a significant change in your waking life. Your relationship with your parents has evolved into a new realm. If you dream about the death of a child, then it implies that you need to let go of your immaturity and start being more serious. As your child reaches certain milestones and grows into an adult, dreaming of their death may be symbolic of their own self-discovery, transition and transformation into a new stage of life.\n - Death: To see someone dying in your dream signifies that your feelings for that person are dead or that a significant change/loss is occurring in your relationship with that person. Alternatively, you may want to repress that aspect of yourself that is represented by the dying person.

I wondered if I was dying.\nSymbols: - Ghost: To see the ghost of a dead friend/relative in your dream suggests guilt and regrets concerning the past relationships with that particular person.\n - Friend: To dream that your best friend is dying suggests that some aspect or quality that your best friend possess is dying within your own self.\n - Death: To dream about the death of a loved one suggests that you are lacking a certain aspect or quality that the loved one embodies. Ask yourself what makes this person special or what you like about them. It is that very quality that you are lacking in your own relationship or circumstances. Alternatively, the dream indicates that whatever that person represents has no part in your own life anymore. In particular, to dream about the death of your living parents indicates that you are undergoing a significant change in your waking life. Your relationship with your parents has evolved into a new realm. If you dream about the death of a child, then it implies that you need to let go of your immaturity and start being more serious. As your child reaches certain milestones and grows into an adult, dreaming of their death may be symbolic of their own self-discovery, transition and transformation into a new stage of life.\n - Death: To see someone dying in your dream signifies that your feelings for that person are dead or that a significant change/loss is occurring in your relationship with that person. Alternatively, you may want to repress that aspect of yourself that is represented by the dying person. If you see a stranger die in your dream, then it implies that you are feeling detached from the changes that are happening around you.\n - Lamp: To see a broken lamp in your dream suggests that you are shutting out those who are trying to help you. It is also symbolic of disappointments, misfortune and bad luck.",

In the stream are big fat fish - salmon perhaps. They are enormously fat. There's an abundance of them, and apparently we can catch them for food. There are several guests arriving, so I catch several and line them up for later. Worryingly, after catching about 15, they seem to run out - I can't see any more coming down the stream. The 'venue' is actually sheltered - perhaps by a marquee. It's warm even though it's night. My eldest daughter is there too. Perhaps it's a wedding party. There are a few other children there, one little girl the same age as my daughter. They go running off together to play. Stupidly I assume they'll be safe, but after about an hour I realize I haven't seen her. A search takes place which gets frantic for a few minutes until eventually I find them under a suspended blanket - they'd made a camp where they'd laid out 2 little beds.\n\n### Symbols:\n- Trout: To see a trout in your dream symbolizes increase prosperity and fortune.\n - Trout: To dream that you catch a trout represents joy and pleasure.

I see an old rundown house and remark, \"I've seen this kind of house before, as in my childhood, maybe living in them.\" I go in and a man and a woman, the sister to the woman who lives in the house, is being critical and judgmental. She doesn't like the way her sister does things and is telling her. The sister is angry and not responsive. I act as a negotiator and say to the sister \"Look, you hit first. So of course, she has to hit back.\" The sister doesn't understand that her negative critical remarks are as harsh as attacking physically.",

Then we went to a nightclub to drink. Then we went to a large gambling room and started to make bets. We really laughed a lot. Among the people who were betting, I saw a very beautiful girl who was alone. I parted with my group to go to where she was and we started to talk. Then we went to a dancing area and danced a long time. I felt attracted by the girl, but at the same time I was thinking about my girlfriend. Then I remember I ended up with this girl in a house of ill repute and there we spent the whole night.",

A few of us went to the right; we had managed to get up towards the roof, towards freedom and escape.  I went back down to find some of the others.  Across the hall was a wall of fire.  There was such destruction everywhere, it was hard to look at.  I managed to find one or two and led them back.  We had trouble climbing back up to the roof.  Some people came looking for us.  After it was over, it all HAD just been a movie.  Then my family and I were at a sort of fair with the Swenson triplets.

The door of the bus remained closed and I started banging on it with my hand for him to open. When he opened the door, he told me I was to take the newer bus. I then was standing around when the driver started talking to me and he recognized my face, but couldn't remember my name. (He then was one of my junior high school teachers.)",

The dreamer is feeling that she is being held back by the system and is taking drastic measures to get control of her destiny. The dreamer is refusing to go along with the system. The dreamer is feeling that her opinions and views are clashing with the majority. The dreamer is feeling that she needs to be more independent and move away from a group setting. The dreamer is feeling that she needs to show more patience and less force. The dreamer is in a learning situation and needs to advance rapidly in life. The dreamer is feeling that she is being recognized for her efforts but is still struggling to remember her name, indicating that she is not fully confident in her abilities. The dreamer is feeling that she is being held back by her past, represented by the junior high school teacher. The dreamer is feeling that she needs to let go of her past and move forward."

         "I was doing a group meeting or lecture in the living room of my birth home. Most of the people in the group were black. I was talking about the power of the subconscious mind and I gave a couple of examples from my own experience. I was really strongly emphasizing that the foundation of it all has to be unconditional faith- that whatever you are wishing for, whatever you are hoping for, whatever you are trying to manifest has to have a strong foundation of faith that it will happen. And I actually used the words you have to have the faith that God loves me, God wants the very best for me, he wants me to be happy, and he will bring this to me. As I was talking, this one lady kept talking to someone else. I asked her a couple of times to please wait until I finished. She would go on. I would ask her again and finally she did stop. Then when I finished I turned to her and I said okay now if you would share. She said, No, I don't want to now. I said, well, that's pretty childish but okay. The people in the group were pretty amazed at the examples I gave them. They left.",
         "On a spiritual note, this dream;To dream that you have malice toward others;Dreaming that someone is being a hypocrite;To dream that you are showing your devotion to your beliefs ;To dream that someone is asking for your permission",
         "The dream is about your spiritual growth and your faith in the universe and God. The fact that the group was mostly black people could symbolize the diversity and inclusiveness of your spiritual journey. The power of the subconscious mind is a reminder that your thoughts and beliefs shape your reality. The lady who kept interrupting you represents someone or something in your waking life that is challenging your faith and your ability to manifest your desires. Your reaction to her shows that you are not letting her negativity affect you and that you are staying true to your beliefs. The fact that the people in the group were amazed by your examples shows that your faith and your spiritual growth are inspiring to others. Overall, the dream is a reminder to stay true to your beliefs and to have faith that the universe will bring you what you desire."

The dreamer is going to run for a political position, which is a significant decision. The dreamer is preparing to vote, which is a symbol of making a choice and taking responsibility for the outcome. The dreamer is looking for a seat to sit, which represents finding a comfortable and secure place to make this decision.\n\nThe dreamer then encounters John Chipka, who offers a bookie. This symbolizes a gamble or risk that the dreamer is taking. The dreamer is then riding over railroad tracks, which represents going against the path that others have laid out for them and doing their own thing. The dreamer sees many tracks, which symbolizes the many choices and paths that are available to them. The dreamer then drives down a dirt road, which represents a more rugged and challenging path.\n\nThe dream does not provide any clear indication of the outcome of the dreamer's decision or the risks they are taking. However, the dream does suggest that the dreamer is making a significant decision and that they are taking a risk in doing so.

It was almost as if I was expecting to be awoken any minute. It's sitting right at the back of my mind what I was dreaming about, but I can't remember it now. I was driving down a highway and apparently I was driving pretty fast and the next thing I knew I was behind a policeman who looks more like a county sheriff. The location I don't know where. I sort of stopped fast and felt sure the policeman was going to stop me. At that time a Jaguar went by fast so the policeman went after him. I almost went off the side of the road because I almost ran into a small island on a turn. There was someone with me, but who it was I don't know. I don't have any idea. The content does not seem real in the sense that it is just not plausible, and I have no idea where it was at.",

         "The dream starts with a person entering the room with a tray of cake, but the dreamer can't remember who it was. This symbolizes a situation in the dreamer's life where they are unsure of the intentions of someone close to them. The dreamer then finds themselves being pulled over by a police officer, indicating that they are feeling guilty about something and are being called into question. The dreamer's fear of being caught leads them to try and evade the situation, represented by the Jaguar that passes by and the police officer going after it instead of the dreamer. The dreamer's inability to remember who was in the car with them suggests that they are unsure of the support they have in this situation and are feeling alone in their guilt. Overall, the dream suggests that the dreamer is feeling guilty about something and is trying to evade the consequences of their actions. They are unsure of the intentions of those around them and are feeling alone in their guilt."

We hug and kiss, and feel very connected with a sweet love. He asks me which things I'll take and I say all of them. I ask him to be tolerant and not laugh. I do take out some of the gem rocks and fossils so the load will be lighter for him and me. I have a blue backpack and a box. I decide to return the big fat book and get a smaller one.

         "The dream is about preparing for a journey, both physically and emotionally. The big fat book about World War I symbolizes the heavy burden of knowledge and information that one must carry in order to understand the complexities of the world and one's place in it. The dreamer's decision to exchange the big book for a smaller one represents the need to simplify and focus on the essential information, rather than being overwhelmed by the vast amount of knowledge.\n\nThe dreamer's decision to go west instead of east symbolizes the need to choose the right path in life, and to avoid the false or dangerous roads. The dreamer's strong sense of love and connection with Robert Mitchum represents the importance of having a strong support system and a loving partner during difficult times.\n\nThe dreamer's decision to pack only some of their things and leave others behind represents the need to prioritize and focus on what is truly important in life. The blue backpack and box symbolize the dreamer's desire to carry only the essentials and to let go of the unnecessary burdens.\n\nOverall, the dream is about the importance of making the right choices and prioritizing what is truly important in life, rather than being overwhelmed by the vast amount of information and responsibilities.

Mateo, who is doing school work, represents the dreamer's responsibilities and obligations. The presence of a man watching implies that the dreamer feels that others are judging her performance in her role as a caretaker.\n\nThe dreamer then gets up to go to the bathroom, which symbolizes the need to address her instinctual urges and emotions. However, she finds that there are no regular toilets, only short baby potty chairs. This suggests that the dreamer feels that she is not able to express her emotions in a mature and healthy way. She struggles to adapt to this new situation, which may represent a change in her life.\n\nThe dreamer then gathers up Mateo's school work and her things, indicating that she is taking on more responsibilities. She changes clothes, which symbolizes a transformation or new beginning. However, the burden of carrying all of these things suggests that the dreamer feels overwhelmed by her responsibilities.\n\nThe dream may be suggesting that the dreamer needs to find a healthier way to express her emotions and instinctual urges. She may need to seek professional help or find a supportive community to help her navigate this change in her life.

This could represent her need to find the right perspective or understanding in a situation. The missing top of the lamp could symbolize a lack of clarity or guidance.\n\nThe two brown wrappers with 4c red stamps could represent opportunities or ideas that the dreamer has come across. However, one is slightly torn and the other is printed on. This could suggest that one opportunity or idea is more promising than the other.

    "2. Same for the Rouge.\n",

    "| **Perplexity** | Candidate text is unpredictable and diverges from reference distribution | Candidate text is predictable, fluent, and aligned with reference distribution | **Low** | < 20 (for good results) | Low perplexity shows that the candidate text is fluent, consistent, and aligned with the reference. |\n",
    "| **ROUGE** | More overlapping n-grams (e.g., unigrams, bigrams) and higher recall of key phrases | Fewer overlapping n-grams and poor recall of key phrases | **High** | 30–50 (good), 50+ (very good) | High ROUGE suggests greater similarity between the candidate and reference texts. |\n",
    "| **BERTScore** | Strong semantic similarity between the candidate and reference text | Weak semantic similarity between the candidate and reference text | **High** | 0.85–0.98 (good) | Higher BERTScore reflects that the candidate preserves the meaning of the reference text. |\n",
