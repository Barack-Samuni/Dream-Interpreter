I started to swim, but it was very hard because there was so many big, sharp rocks.  But in the middle of the ocean, there wasn't any rocks.,  I started to swim out, but there was a huge wave,  so I swam back.  While doing this I cut my toe.  I got to shore and I met Heleyna there.  She told me: \"Don't get in a boat here, because you just get cut from the rocks.\"  Then a big whale was in the ocean, and then the whole ocean became an aquarium.  Then it became a theatre, and Cassie was up on stage singing.  I was the stage manager, and I was sitting with the unicorns, because this was a fantasy play.  I went home and started listening to records.  I realized I didn't have a sing to sing for the talent show the next day, so I panicked and tried to pick out a good song I knew.  The next morning, I got up on stage and decided to sing \"Lean on Me.\"",
         " - Ocean:  To see an ocean in your dream represents the state of your emotions and feelings. It is indicative of spiritual refreshment, tranquility and renewal. Alternatively, the dream means that you are feeling empowered and unhindered. You have a positive outlook in life and are not limited by anything. If you are sailing across the ocean, then it signifies new found freedom and independence. You are showing great courage. If the ocean is rough, then the dream represents some emotional turmoil. You are doing your best to handle life's ups and downs.\n - Reef:  To see a reef in your dream suggests that you are blocking out subconscious material from emerging onto the surface. Alternatively, the dream may also mean a refuge or protection from your emotions.\n - Sea:  To see the sea in your dream represents your subconscious and the transition between your subconscious and conscious. As with all water symbols, it also represents your emotions. The dream may also be a pun on your understanding and perception of a situation. 'I see' or perhaps there is something you need to 'see' more clearly. Alternatively, the dream indicates a need to reassure yourself or to offer reassurance to someone. It brings about hope, a new perspective and a positive outlook on life no matter how difficult your current problems may be.\n - Sea Creature:  To see a sea creature in your dream represents an emotional transformation. If the sea creature is captured or in captivity, then it indicates that you are keeping your emotions contained, which can be harmful to your well-being in the end.\n - Underwater:  To dream that you are underwater suggests that you are being overcome with emotions and are in over your head regarding some situation. You need to gain greater control of your life. To dream that you are breathing underwater represents a retreat back into the womb. You want to return to a state where you were dependent and free from responsibilities. Perhaps you are feeling helpless, unable to fulfill your own needs and to care for yourself. Alternatively, breathing underwater is analogous to being submerged in your own emotions. To see houses under water implies that you are very comfortable with your own emotions. Alternatively, the dream may be a reflection of your housing situation. Perhaps you are 'underwater' in your mortgage. To dream of an underwater city represents your subconscious. Through deeper understanding of yourself, you find commonality and shared experiences with others. To see objects underwater in your dream symbolizes your suppressed feelings as represented by the objects. The objects may trigger some emotional memory which you still need to confront and work through. For example, children's toys or bicycles refer to an emotion that you suppressed in childhood. To see a car underwater in your dream points to feelings of regret or sadness over an abandoned goal. Dreaming that you are flying underwater represents control over your emotions. You are comfortable with confronting your feelings directly.",
         "The dream starts with the dreamer having a sleepover with friends in her house. This symbolizes a sense of comfort and security in her current environment and relationships. The dreamer then goes to the beach with her mother and two other friends. The beach represents a place of renewal and tranquility. The dreamer's difficulty in swimming through the rocky ocean symbolizes her struggle to navigate through her emotions and feelings. The fact that there are no rocks in the middle of the ocean represents a sense of calm and peace that she finds in the midst of her emotional turmoil. The huge wave that the dreamer encounters represents a challenge or obstacle that she must face. The dreamer's injury symbolizes the pain and hurt that she experiences as a result of this challenge. Heleyna's warning about getting in a boat represents the potential danger or harm that the dreamer may face if she does not take care of herself emotionally.\n\nThe appearance of the whale and the transformation of the ocean into an aquarium and then a theatre symbolizes the dreamer's ability to find joy and creativity in her emotions and feelings. The fantasy play represents the dreamer's imagination and her ability to transform her emotions into something beautiful and meaningful. The dreamer's realization that she does not have a song for the talent show represents her fear of not being able to express herself effectively in a public setting. The dreamer's decision to sing \"Lean on Me\" symbolizes her need for support and connection with others in times of emotional need.\n\nOverall, the dream represents the dreamer's emotional journey and her ability to navigate through the ups and downs of her feelings. The dream also highlights the importance of finding peace and tranquility in the midst of emotional turmoil and the power of creativity and imagination in transforming negative emotions into something positive and beautiful.",

         "The Spiral Flight  I walk over near a line of people to get on a plane. My classmate from Brimson Anthony Holden is there. There are some people already in line for the flight. I try to find the right place to stand, because the line seems to branch off into two lines. I choose one of the lines and stand in the metal corral-like line. I'm then the first person in line. A woman calls out for anyone who is flying to Reinhorse, which I know is in Germany, to come to the front of the line. Several men walk by me and descend a staircase to talk to the woman. I hear the woman ask if any of them are willing to change flights, because the flight they're on is really full. The woman says they don't have to change, because they do all have a seat on the flight, but if they did change they would receive compensation. While they talk, we all start to move, and I realize we're going onto a plane flying to Los Angeles. We take off and immediately make a hard right turn. The plane keeps rolling, and we fly in a spiral, spinning like a top as we fly forward. One of the engines is out, and that is causing the spiral. The stewardess says the passengers need to pound on the inside of the walls to get the engine to start, as if it is just stuck. The emergency exit on the plane is open. The engine doesn't start. We spin and fly. People are yelling. I sit next to several men, including my housemate Stephen Ramos. I yell and laugh. We are in a pretty good mood considering we're probably going to die. I joke about how our plane crashing could make a great Fox television special, like \"World's Worse Plane Crashes\". We don't gain altitude, and must land. There is a train below us entering a train yard. If we could land on top of the fast train, we wouldn't crash, and the train could just slow down. We seem to be going in for a landing at the train yard. Then our plane is on the snow-covered ground on a street, sliding, not very fast. I think that since we're in the nose of the plane if the plane slides into the house at the end of the road we could get hurt. The plane stops on the road. I get out of the plane and talk to Stephen. I tell him this whole episode has been so amazing that I must be dreaming. I say this very nonchalantly. I turn and look back and the plane isn't there: I am dreaming! The street is empty: without any people or a plane.",
         " - Baby Carriage:  To see a baby carriage in your dream symbolizes your desire for a family or longing for a baby. If the baby carriage is empty, then it indicates sadness or an unfulfilled goal. Alternatively, it suggests that you need to cater to the needs of your own inner child.\n - Hanging:  To watch a hanging in your dream represents feelings of insecurity. The hanging may symbolize aspects of yourself that you want to eliminate.\n - Knocking:  To hear knocking in your dreams suggests that your subconscious is trying to attract your attention to some aspect of yourself or to some waking situation. A new opportunity may be presented to you. Alternatively, the dream may be a pun that you are 'knocking' on or insulting something or someone. Or perhaps there is a habit or behavior that you to stop or 'knock it off'.\n - Ramp:  To dream that you are going up a ramp signifies your struggles in achieving a goal. It is symbolic of your determination and ambition. If you fail to go up a ramp, then it suggests that you are not able to overcome your difficulties. There are still obstacles standing on your way. To dream that you are going down a ramp refers to some instability and lack of control in your life.\n - Teleportation:  To teleport in your dream represents your desires to escape your current situation or to move more faster and easier through it. You may be expressing some frustrations with how your waking life is proceeding and the slow speed that it is moving at.",
         "The dreamer is in a situation where he feels like he is stuck, like he is in a line and unable to move forward. He is trying to find his place in the line, but the situation seems to be chaotic and unclear. He is then called to the front of the line, but instead of going to his desired destination, he ends up on a plane going to Los Angeles. The plane then experiences turbulence and starts to spin in a spiral. The engine is out and the passengers are in danger. The dreamer and his housemate are in a good mood, joking about the situation. They are able to land the plane, but it is not clear if they are safe. The dreamer then realizes he is dreaming and the situation disappears.\n\nThe dreamer's subconscious is expressing feelings of being stuck and uncertain about his place in the world. He is trying to find his way forward, but the situation seems chaotic and unclear. The dreamer's desire to go to Reinhorse, which is in Germany, may represent a longing for a sense of belonging or a connection to his roots. However, he ends up on a plane going to Los Angeles, which may symbolize a desire for excitement and adventure.\n\nThe spiral flight and the engine that is out may represent feelings of instability and lack of control in the dreamer's life. The dreamer and his housemate are able to maintain a good mood despite the danger, which may suggest that the dreamer is able to find humor and joy in difficult situations. The dreamer's realization that he is dreaming may represent a sense of relief or a desire to escape the chaos and uncertainty of the situation.\n\nThe symbols in the dream do not seem to have a clear connection to the dream narrative. However, the ramp in the dream may represent the dreamer's determination and ambition to overcome difficulties and achieve his goals. The knocking in the dream may symbolize the dreamer's subconscious trying to attract his attention to some aspect of himself or to some waking situation. The teleportation in the dream may represent the dreamer's desire to escape his current situation or to move more quickly and easily through it.

         "Snowblower Thieves  I'm sitting on a ledge of a wall or building in downtown Wilmerton. The ledge overlooks the main parking lot next to the movie theatre, with Perkins on my left side. The ledge is about 20-30 feet off the ground. The parking lot is empty and the sun is rising. A teacher is on my left, and my brother Wally and another man are on my right. Two men come out of a first floor door of some apartments and jump down to the ground unscathed! I'm amazed at this, because it is a 25-foot drop, and neither man so much as flinches. They immediately rush into a store with guns to rob it. They may have ski masks on. One of the robbers brings a man out of the store at gunpoint. The robber then goes back into the store. The man from the store has an Oozy machine gun that he holds behind his back. The robber emerges from the sore and goes towards the man. The robber takes the man's gun. The second robber brings two young women out of the store. Each woman is pushing a snowblower. The snowblowers are being stolen. The snowblowers are put into the bed of a small gray truck and the two women and the man are put in the passenger seat: all three are taken captive. One of the robbers gets in the truck and speeds over towards us to pick up the other robber. He skids to a stop very close to us and the second robber gets in the truck. Those I am with and I have guns. I have a huge black M-16 assault rifle. It's a mammoth gun and could really do some damage. The truck has stopped right around the corner of the building ledge we're sitting on. I whirl around and aim my rifle at the driver's seat where the two robbers are sitting, as they drive away. I'm shaky with the gun: I've never worked it before, and it's all I can handle. I don't fire any shots, and the truck pulls away. One of the men I'm with thinks I pointed the gun at his head when I spun around and took aim. I thought the safety of the gun was off, and it was ready to fire, but I see now it was on the whole time. I'm in a truck. I have two arrows stuck in my left forearm. I pull them out. A third arrow has been shot in my arm, and I pull it out too. I bleed a very small bit, and the wound on the surface is small. I'm on a big swing with others. I still have my gun. I lose my shoe: it lies on the ground. I try to pick it up when we swing over it. We are done swinging then. I have books of matches that I keep in my socks.",

         "The group of us had just heard something about Africa, a talk. We were thinking of going there. My grandfather had evidently been ____________________. He had some relations living with him at the time, but it seems as if one of them died. He was about a 75-year-old man. I found myself, plus a few other people, were going on a trip, but before we went, my mother wanted me to go over and ask my grandfather about the feasibility of our family going to Africa. We were in a 1955 Plymouth. So we went over there and I was appointed to ask him. When I first got in, he was busy talking with a doctor. The doctor, I guess, was just giving him a little examination and also talking about the glories of Africa. It also seems that the doctor was something like a vacuum cleaner salesman, but that's a little foggy, and I can't quite remember it. When the doctor finally got through talking to my grandfather, I asked him about Africa and taking my parents. He said a very emphatic no. He said my mother cold never live there. He said there were too many snakes. He said that you live net to a big zoo because they had caged animals, but he said the only way you could live down there was to shoot and kill the food, and he didn't think my mother would ever get along. I went back to the car. It seems as if my mother had gone on to a camp we were staying at and the car had come back and it had 2 other guys and myself so that there were 3 in all, but we drove a ways and then we came to a large zoo, just like the one my grandfather described in Africa. It almost seems as if we were in Africa. We looked around there for a while, and then there were 3 African people who came up to the car and wondered if we were going back to camp. We said we were, so they asked for a ride. The car started back for camp, and I remember we were all rather tired as it had been a long trip. The guys said to stop at the next bar and get a drink. I was a little worried because I knew my mother wouldn't like it if she smelled it, and also we had one guy that I was sure was under 21. Now for this scene it seemed to be sort of in the United States because there were tobacco fields and the billboards were in English. There was one lipstick billboard and therefore red lips on the girl. Just about this time the alarm went off.",

         "(06/07/1999)(I was) waiting in the waiting room at some kind of doctor's office. There were other people there and my mind was on getting a pair of those fold-up plastic chairs. In this waiting room I had been searching for this pair of plastic fold-up glassed that they give you at the eye doctor. They were in an envelope in the bathroom. I was real excited to find them; that I went to tell the teachers at the grammar school that I had found just what I'd wanted. There were plastic and paper fold-up glasses. There was a lady with real glasses, but she had somebody else's glasses on (not her prescription). I was skipping school that day. I was trying not to get found out. I was trying to come up with a plan to leave. There was a typewriter there and I was trying to just type as fast as I could, and just hit any keys. The stuff came out on the page, \"x j l k , x j l k , x j l k , . \" But the letters were not in straight lines. They went up and down and up and down, in a sort of 'Navajo-ish' pattern on the page. I didn't say anything. I tried to type out some words. The patterns were nice. There were no vowels. I tried to type in a straight line but I could get no vertical action on the typewriter. It was all horizontal. I thought, \"I'll type up a grocery list.\" But I didn't need to get anything anyway. I had run through the red light where the turn off for the grocery was suppose to be, so I was already past there. The phone in this waiting room office was ringing and it was Stephen and he was angry. He was trying to get in there (in the office door) and he was calling. He said, \"Merri, it's STEPHEN.\" And he hung up the phone. On the way to the grocery store was the gray section, and a wooden shack with a sign on a wooden stick that I loved, and instead there was an Amoco station. The man in the car said, \"There's a grocery store in Albany.\" And I was driving. I said, \"We don't have to go half that far.\"",

The water bubbled and then Deadpool came walking out, but he was covered in seaweed and stuff and you couldn't see him at all, he was completely green. He walked into the resort. Then it went back and showed Morena Baccarin coming out of the water and she had a mermaid costume on, which showed her cleavage. I was annoyed that they gave her the 'decorative female' treatment.

We're in an old gym with fully tile-like floors playing basketball. I remember looking down at the court from balcony. We aren't making very m any shots. My arms feel rubbery. There is a pole vault contraption built into the floor. It pops up when you step or bounce a ball on it. We walk out the north side of the gym. My friend Nate Nelling is with us.

Stephen is there and I know he doesn't want to go but we are going anyways, because Nate wants to go. We start walking. There is a monastery on our right and people are sitting; we can see though a window. A man and a woman walk across the path. They are older, and neither is wearing shirts. The woman is fat, and looks like a man. I can't distinguish her breasts.  We are near a river with some debris in it, including wood pallets, a suitcase, and frogs. A lot of frogs are in and around the river. We can see them well even though they are down a steep rocky bank about 50 feet away.  I'm in a shelter with no walls, like at Mud Lake. There is a stream flowing out of it. I'm sitting at the edge of the stream and grab two frogs. They urinate a lot, much more than they weigh! I think I throw a frog at my friend Ivory Alshire, and want to give the other to my brother Wally, who is getting his photograph taken with a girl. Someone criticizes me for this.",

My grade school classmate Misty Ryan is a server for the mass. The priest is Father Vance Brock. At the end of mass Father Vance asks if anyone wants to stay and serve a funeral. A lot of people raise their hands or jump up, because they'll get out of the rest of the day at Carter School if they serve. I hope I don't get called on. Father Vance selects three people, not me. Then he tells the rest of us \"cocksuckers\" to leave. My grade school classmate Gino Teavor is there. I grab his jacket for him. Outside is it icy: very slippery. Others and I go over to Carter School. We haven't eaten lunch yet, and it's early afternoon. My friends Tiny and Matt Combs, and Jeff and Ryan Vaurnet are there. They're going to Jefferson School to have a fish fry for lunch in a trailer home. I haven't eaten since I've been in church, so I ask them if I can go with if they'll have enough fish. They say I can. I go upstairs to the secretary's office where I find a television and a VCR. I unplug them to go past them, and then plug them back in. I walk down the dark upstairs hallway with a light in my hand. The doors to the classrooms aren't closed tightly. I don't know which grade I'm in. I hear faint voice in my sixth grade teacher Sherry Devine's room. I don't want to interrupt the people, so I go to the bathroom. There is a tiger in the bathroom. It is huge and strong but gentle. There is a dog with antlers tied to its head. There are two cats, one of which is nice and the other mean. The mean cat climbs up my leg and scratches me. I grab it by the back of the neck and hold it, like I am choking it. I go out of the bathroom and find my name and coat rack underneath it. I'm near the door, I think, because my teachers have always seen me as being responsible enough to be away from the teacher's coat rack. I put the battery charger on my coat rack. The coat rack of an acquaintance of mine named Debbie Oliver is next to mine. Debbie and Sherry Devine walk out of the room. Debbie is starting 6th grade at Carter School. Sherry has some very crisp waffles. She says I can go eat with the others. The others have left.",

         "I saw my cousin clearly as she was being questioned and reproached by her father. Next to her was my aunt who also scolded her severely. The matter being discussed was that she had acted thoughtlessly and without knowing it, she had messed things up. I must confess that when I awoke, I thought this incident was true and that the dream had really taken place, and that their reaction (my uncle's and aunt's) had been okay. Thinking about it a good while, before breakfast, I remembered that this had never happened, and that everything was in order. I must disclose the fact that I would have wanted something like this to happen, because the problem went as follows: A few days ago, my brother's fiancé came to my home while my cousin was visiting. I told my cousin that this was a person my mother knew, and she, due to something that was said, thought that she was my grandmother's godchild. Naturally I only told her this because my brother had recently been engaged and he expressly asked us not to tell the family about it, in order to avoid comments due to the young age of the bride-to-be. But my mother could not hide the fact any longer and when my uncle came to pick up my cousin, she told him that her son's fiancé had come, but she didn't say anything to my cousin, and she didn't find out. The worst of it is that this incident has left me very nervous, and I don't even want to go to my cousin's because then she will ask me why I didn't tell her, etc. It's been a week since my cousin's visit, but all the members of my family, including my parents and myself, are very nervous about the reaction of the other members of my family. I think that this has influenced my dream a lot. Coming back to the dream: I remember that my uncle was telling my cousin, \"You are a fool; you shouldn't have said anything,\" and my aunt, \"What they must have thought!\" My cousin was answering, \"But I didn't buy the magazines, they gave them to me; besides, what was I to do? They were not going to throw me out of the house for letting him know that they were keeping so many magazines and hadn't paid taxes for them.\" Her parents were still reproaching her, her lack of tact, until she lowered her head and left, while they made angry faces, as though they were angry at themselves.",

We opened the door and it looked more like 4pm. It was cloudy though. I think I was a vampire too. I had pants on and we grabbed a jacket to hold over us and we ran out. Spike ripped a branch off a bush with leaves to hold in front of his face to protect it. We went to this shop. It was really confusing to get there from where we were. I had to jump into this little thing, which was like an elevator. It was like a waist-high tray, which you stood in and had to control it yourself. It was hard to control, and would tilt and could go upside down. I wasn't very good at it and had to keep holding on to the ropes and going up really high, when I needed to go down, etc. This lady was waiting and got impatient and made it go back to her. Eventually I got into the shop. I was in the aisle with the chocolates but they all had expired years ago. I was looking at the Chomps, Kinder Surprises etc. Spike asked me for them, and then we were sneaking them into girls' bags. He told me earlier he was in love with Buffy. He was talking about it, but it seemed like he actually liked me. There was a competition thing which a bunch of girls had entered by filling out forms. There was a guy with a gun and he shot this dog and it fell over in a dead heap. A policeman captured him. I was lying on my back on the ground and Spike came on top of me and we started making out.

         "Feels like the same ol' chicken soup dream yet I don't know if I've ever dreamt about this soup before. Crush was playing. My dad hired them I think. They played in this church/bar parking lot. Nobody came. I was pissed cause they would take long 1/2 hour breaks or longer between each song. I tried to tell them they sucked but would then just apologize for what I said. In the parking lot, 2 other bands were practicing quietly. One band wore all cavemen outfits and they were set up like Hollywood Squares. I wanted to go camping. I had this favorite trail that I started doing over and over again. It almost became like a personal race course. There was one area where the trail split. The one way I never went, went across a river. There was a lean-to. The lean-to, as I eventually found out one day was a loft with a nice double bed, a closet, lights - just like a regular bedroom. It had once belonged to the woman who owned 14 K. Street. A lot of her stuff was still in there - clothes, books, curtains, photo albums. There was also my moms storage stuff like a sewing machine and thread. I looked throughout the album and saw a picture of the lady as a little girl. She looked exactly like me. A little boy looked just like Eric. In another picture the father looked like Roger. I ripped a picture out. When I got back from hiking, the band was still on break - I'm pissed. I tell everyone that we should all go camping and stay in the lean-to and that I'll make some French Onion chicken soup. Ronny tells everyone that my soup sucks. Ahmad asks him why he doesn't make it then and Ronny says because he hates it but if Ahmad gets him 30 lbs of dog meat then he'll cook it for us the right way. I show my mother the picture and she is surprised. Sam and Kim said that they would go camping but then Kim backs out. So Sam asks if just he and I would want to go. Hmmmm, i think, that would be fun. He wants to climb a mountain though, and not go on my special trail (which is basically flat) with the lean-to. One thing i forgot....when I was going down hills on the trail it almost had the affect of skydiving. I felt like my hands were holding onto two bannisters and I would slide down the slope from he sky. Sometimes the geography would turn into a map-like feature. I could see small trees and the outline of the path and I would try to aim for that. The size of the tree tops were about the size of quarters.

There were two doors that would take us to the entrance. I went to one, but I saw this freaky lobster/scorpion thing so I left there. I thought I saw a crocodile. A couple and a young girl came in and the baby was near the crocodile, so I called out to the parents and a light turned on. It was just a cat. It looked evil and talked to me. I said that I wanted to get through and it was like \"Ok, go ahead\". I asked it about the lobster thing and it said it didn't know what it was, but \"maybe it is lethal\". Ezra and I went to these stairs to leave and a girl went through some doors and a lobster thing got through. The doors to get out wouldn't open. There were these rope things hanging from the ceiling and I grabbed one and swung away from the stairs. Jude Law (as Jerome Morrow in Gattaca) was there, his name was spelt wrong somewhere. He offered to get bitten by the lobster thing to see what happened. He could then walk, so everyone was like \"Let's go\", but I said that it might still be deadly. Lots of people ended up dying. Some army guys came. Some lady had a card that would allow two people to leave. Someone and I left. We went to this place and they had this machine where you could ask about any one and see who their \"soul mate\" was. When I put in 'Mom', it said Nana and Poppa and they realized that I'd 'stolen' the card. I ended up back underground. Eventually a lady came through the doors and we were allowed out. I hugged a car when we got outside. They blew up the place and it turned out it was our school. I said \"We start school in a few days and now they blew up the school\". Dad said \"only the nice part\". Behind the school there were some big white buildings and I saw Mr Willingham walking on there. Ezra asked who the math teacher was and I said \"Mr Gutenberg\".",

A seemingly nice guy said something to me, and I sat with him.  He was probably going to flirt with me, but I chose to make no assumptions and enjoy.  Then 4 other guys came over.  All the others had moustaches.  I thought about my boyfriend Jeremy and how he doesn't have one, and thought about saying I like that better.  They were all nice and talked to me, one especially.  4 of them left, and so I was left with the last nice guy.  I got up and went somewhere, but got lost on the way back.  I had no pants on.  I wanted to leave.  There was some transition from that into an odd sort of game that I did not seem to be very good at.  I was to lay out my clothes covering Jeremy or our cat Buster.  There was some trick to it that I couldn't get the hang of, of covering some spots twice before others once before time ran out.  Jeremy encouraged me to keep trying. Then it was something of having to pass inspection before I could leave.  There were some odd shaped (semi rectangular) neon lights above, and the clothes had to be completely clean and unwrinkled before I could leave. I started to get upset.  Bright orange shorts- no, black, no..Someone oddly dressed came into my room (where I now was) and wanted to help me.  I ended up dressed like a clown (more so than she).   This may have been part of the chemistry area.  I was in a small room with a lot of birds.  Black finches, mostly.  Some crows, as well.  I went to an area where there were some birds that were still young and furry.  There was a random leg, kind of disgusting.  I got the idea of wanting a bird at school.  At home we swam in the pool in the backyard. I told my mother about wanting a bird.  She said I should ask my landlord/housemate Andre first.  She was getting ready.  She was thinking of taking a job, and so she was going to 'try out' for six days, working for the catering part of the PTA or something.  She had me help her with the latex gloves.",

We were walking together and Mom was walking in front of us. I said that I was quiet so I could \"play more games\" and he laughed. Mom looked around and asked if he was Lumpy and he said his name was Daryl Kemp and I said \"I call him Lumpy\". Then Calvin and I were talking and he said that he heard something about Mr Fantastic (Fantastic Four). I said I already knew he died and he was like \"how?\" and I said that I was there (I had killed him) but I told him not to tell anyone because we were pretending that I wasn't there. I went to some shop with Evelyn, which was where she worked. There were some weird dancing things. Some L plates broke and we got some yellow card to replace them. I was walking with Calvin through the back of the shop. I was singing along to the song on the radio. I heard Dmitri saying that new music was \"rubbish\". Then I was at school and we were in the common room which was bigger and really different. Eugene and someone came in. After heaps of people were in there someone locked the door. Eventually they unlocked it. This teacher gave out ice-creams. They gave a blue one to Eugene, a pink one to Bradley and mixed ones to Darius and Jeremiah. I went into some room and this lady teacher was telling me how she would design it if it were her home. Earlier Mom was in a carpark and she parked smoothly into a spot and this other car drove past the area. Then it reverse parked into the spot behind her car. Lloyd (Entourage) was driving it and Ari (Entourage) was yelling at him.",

         "In this one I was in a rather large, unfamiliar place that looked somewhat like the portals at San Martin Square (Lima). Instead of sidewalks and roads, it was some sort of a yard that was next to a wall (something like a seawalk), but this place was not by the sea. I was with a bunch of guys, around my age, and I started to think that I was the only woman in the place, and at that moment a bus that picked up people who worked in a nightclub passed by. This called our attention and we were asking each other questions. In spite of being surrounded by so many people, I felt lonely. At this point I turned around and saw a group of three girls, among whom there was a friend who went to school with me (she sat next to me in school and we formed a quartet which we called ARAB from the initials of the four names; it's the best way to describe her). When we started to talk, I remembered that she had relatives in Chimbote and I asked her if her family was alright, if nothing had happened to them in the May 31st earthquake which affected that zone. She told me that two of her brothers had died. Then she laughed and said it was a lie, and I was so relieved! I also asked her about her brother (older than she) whom we used to tease when she wrote letters to him in school. She told me he was alright and that he always remembered the quartet that teased him. I don't know how I got away from them and I became like a child in my behavior. I wanted to play, jump, laugh, because I felt lonely and bored. I could see the group of boys doing their thing on one side and the girls on the other. Then they started to come toward me one by one because they were also bored. I had tried to call their attention. We started to look at the stores and then we saw a group of foreign sailors and we thought we would introduce ourselves to them and did so. They were either North American or English (one of these, and it seems they were North American). They only spoke English; none of them knew Spanish. One of the girls who knew English started to translate what they and we were saying. Since I didn't understand anything in English, because I always studied French, I felt kind of strange and kept getting more bored. The girl who knew English had graduated from a British school which is near my home and her parents are North American. I know several girls from that school and know that they come out speaking English perfectly, but I don't remember this girl. Truthfully, she wasn't one of the ones I know. That was all of my dream, because I awoke at that moment.",

I went to go up but he had blocked the stairs with a small bomb. I ran out and he came out after me, throwing them everywhere, some people were dead, but everyone else was inside. We ran to the front of the house. The house was burning and Eli and I were holding hands. We then went to a big fancy house, that had this little room that was open with a small TV on inside. We watched it until we saw someone in the bushes, so we ran out the other door, but there were lots more people. Some lady shot us with these magnet things that slow down your heart rate and makes you pass out. Eli's heart wasn't slowing, and he was breathing normally. I couldn't breathe properly and the lady was saying, about Eli, that it wasn't normal/human. I grabbed Eli's hand which gave me a boost. They took us to this lab where we passed out for about 5 seconds. It gave us a boost. We were throwing sharp things at them. I killed 6 people.

         "This is a dream from about a week ago. This is a dream that took place about two weeks ago. It takes place in a drug store, and as I walk into the drug store I recognize a girl at the counter who I went to high school with. Next to her in a small cradle of some sort is a child, very young child. I went over to her and asked her, \"How are you getting along, and to whom are you married? Who is your husband?\" She said something to the extent that, \"Well, I can't have one.\" She couldn't have a husband. I then got the impression of two guys who I knew that had been dating her. Someone at this point carried a large rack of cakes past us. They were all rolls, like jelly rolls, but they were slightly bigger. She continued our conversation and said she had remained alright in spite of the situation. I looked at the baby. It was about 1 year old. This situation, meaning that I felt certain that this was an illegitimate child. Thoughts then of making a play for this girl pass through my mind. She looked into my eyes and asked, \"How come you look that way?\" I knew she was referring to the dark rings around my eyes. I said, \"That's because I've just finished studying for a big exam, and I haven't been getting much sleep for about nine days.\" Her comment was, \"Well!\" Then I said, \"You should have stayed in school like me and avoided getting involved with anything.\" She said, \"Well, we didn't let them get to either one of us anyway.\" By this she meant that we really didn't let people get to us anyway and hurt us. The faint impression that she was wrong about herself passed through my mind. For some reason I had to leave and we parted very friendly. I then thought, \"I can really make this girl.

She's not that hard to make, and why don't you pick someone who's not so easy to make?\" While in the drug store I had seen several people there - the waitress who was dressed in a white uniform and the policeman who was dressed in a blue uniform and several customers sitting at the counter. As I left the drug store, the setting was identical to a corner drug store in Audubon, N.J. where I lived for many years.  Day residue: Next to a drug store yesterday. I went to a drug store yesterday. I also got a letter from my brother who's wife is ready to have a baby any day now, and she's having trouble carrying the child. One of the girl's teeth in the dream seemed bad. It seemed sort of decayed and this might derive from the telling and retelling yesterday of what struck me as a hilarious Yiddish epithet, translated it is, \"All your teeth should fall out but one, and in that one you should have a toothache.\"",

I pick up a hang bag containing a single article, hurry toward to the hotel. close behind me are 4 or 6 convicted criminals who are guarded by 2 officers carrying repeating rifles. The criminals are to be shot just as they reach the short flight of stairs leading down to the entrance of the Williard Hotel; and I am in danger of being hit, as I am only a few steps ahead of them. However, I manage to act unconcerned and unhurried as I start down the steps, but once down, I quickly duck into a room to my left and proceed to rear of hotel without coming out into corridor again. I then walk up stairs to top of hotel (about 6 stories). Just before reaching upper floor I hear the noise of an elevator door opening (or closing) and I \"freeze\" for a few moments, fearing that the passenger will see me. I then notice that the elevator door was closing, and this seemed to show conclusively that a passenger had gotten off, and by this time doubtless was in a room. I have on a blue shirt which makes me feel rather conspicuous, thought I console myself with the thought that soon I will be far away. Before leaving the hotel, however, I determine to get a good supper. The top floor seems familiar, and I wander about hunting for an empty room, or some other place to hide in temporarily. All the rooms seem occupied and I am beginning to feel rather concerned. There isn't a place, even, where my hand bag doesn't look dangerously conspicuous. Far off to one side is an unfinished portion of the hotel, and I would like very much to be there -- but the risk of being recognized is too great, so stay where I am. I pick up a hand bag that was sitting next to a hat tree. Soon a man, dressed in a light colored suit having a fine check, approaches and I know the hand bag belongs to him, and I therefore replace it. (That part where I am in is dimly lighted and I feel comparatively safe.) Then a colored maid appears and suggests that I put my trousers on a hanger. The maid's place is taken by a black man who has a pair of trousers in his hands, and by gestures he shows me just how he recommends the hanging of trousers. I say all right, I'll do it after supper, and begin looking for my bag which apparently has been taken by someone. I am busily searching for bag when alarm wakens me.",

Dmitri was there and looked really hot. Eugene and Bradley were also there. People were sleeping over too. I put a glass in the fridge and there was a countdown from five and it exploded. Dad yelled and said to never put a glass directly in the fridge. Later, I went to the toilet which was facing 90 degrees counter clockwise from where it does face and left the door pulled to. I peed and went to wipe, when Dmitri started talking to me and someone else came along as well. Later, this girl and I got into an argument and she was being bitchy to everyone. Her friend was also bitching with her. Everyone was then gone except those two, and she was still carrying on and I turned around and started yelling at her calling her a bitch. She got up angrily and I had this butcher knife and I hit her and her friend with it, and then ate them. I went out to Dad and said I ate them \"not in a weird sex way\" and he started helping clean up the evidence. They had been on a mattress with blankets and had left some spots of blood. I put the blankets in a basket. I put her suitcase and stuff together. Dad went out to do something. There was a knock on the door and some salesmen were there. They gave me a card and a paper bag and left smiling. The card said 'to Izzy' and then had some crap about donating to poor people. They returned not long after and I gave it back and said 'sorry, not interested'. They were bothered by this. The girl's phone on was the bed and kept vibrating because a friend was ringing. There was a voicemail from me, which I'd left earlier, of me yelling at her. I took the suitcase and a bag outside, and got a few houses down but then I saw people from the reunion across the street and the salesmen coming back, so I left it and went back. The salesmen had gone inside, but I couldn't find them. Then there were kids in the house demanding donations. I was thinking this was ridiculous and that we weren't going to get away with this at all now. Then it changed to a father and young son. He had 'made' friends, but they had died. Then they were escaping from something, and the kid got new friends and a dog (all created) and then they walked away happily.",

         "This one happened when I was out selling brushes, and I had one customer. All she liked to do was talk. She would get me into her apt. and talk. I talked with her I think for three quarters of an hour the first day I went out. I thought, \"Boy, I'm really going to get a sale when I go back.\" I was real nice to her. She said she was quite sure she would buy something the next time I came around.  Well, I knocked on her door and she was very happy to see me. She let me in and said, \"Sit down.\" She started right over to a table, and I thought, \"Oh boy, this is wonderful. She's going to have me write out orders.\" Then she started talking about a car accident she was in, how she was getting insurance now. This rather perturbed me because I thought I was going to get a sale, and so I began to try to sell her some things and remind her of things she might need. She sort of looked at me and laughed, and said there wasn't a thing she needed, and I wasn't going to get a sale at all. She went on and I finally made the excuse that I had to get to work because I didn't make money that day. She said ok and went next door to her daughter's apartment. Now I was just going out as she opened the door to this apartment. It was dark, Victorian decorated. Her daughter was going to the supermarket, and some woman asked her to buy her a brush, a hair brush. I was about halfway down the stairs at this time, and this got me a little mad. I said, \"What's wrong with a Fuller brush?\" She said, \"Oh, they don't make the kind I like.\" I said, \"We make three kinds. Have you tried them all or seen them all?\" She said no. She wasn't aware that we had all those kinds. So I came back up and I showed her the catalogue. She found the kind she wanted. She was somewhat reluctant, but she said, \"Ok, you can order this one for me.\" Finally I got my sale from her, and the dream ended there. The dream probably just stems from my desire to get a sale, especially from this woman because I was quite disturbed the second time I came back to her, about a week ago, and I didn't get a sale from her. As I said, this was a short dream. It probably only lasted five minutes. I do remember some color, certainly in the catalogue there was one of the pink brushes, the yellow page. I guess that's about all.",

Then I was there and we were all trying the keys in locked boxes. Then I wasn't there and it was a trap to kill them as no keys fit. Then it was different and people would wish for someone to die, but they would also die. The main guy from Zombieland was there. He was with a lady and he realized she was trying to kill him. She was a demon or something. I think he escaped but then this girl was there, and then it was me. I snuck out of the door and into a car. There were heaps of cars and it was night. I was driving out and kept hitting them but kept maneuvering around and got out. She came out to stop me but I got away. The deaths from the wishes happened within 5 minutes, I think, and they were random. I was then near where the dude lived. I found the street and went and found him. He was in a small building like a demountable but it was only room. He let me in and we were discussing the situation. Then it felt weird and we had been waiting for people to arrive. They tipped the building over and we fell on top of each other in the corner of it. They were good guys, but had thought something was up. I went on IMDb after finishing the movie and people were discussing bite marks that the people had. They thought it looked Latin. It had an 8.8/10 rating but not many votes. This guy said it was poorly edited and was lame. It was going to be turned into a TV show. Someone suggested Zachary Quinto (I assumed it was for the bad guy). They said he could say his name like \"I am Scaaarrr\". Some people suggested some people for the female parts, but they were all stupid choices (like tween stars). The person who had suggested Quinto, also suggested Hayden Panettiere. Then I was at home but it was different. My room was next to the toilet which was next to the backyard and my room was away from the other rooms. I could hear bass from some music [note: last night there was loud bass coming from somewhere]. I had been in bed for 4 hours and got up at 2am to go to the toilet. I saw people dancing outside. I got Darren and Mom up and Darren was angry but went to check. He knew this girl out there called Sarah. She turned the bass down and talked to me through the window. She was doing a PVC course? They let out tiny bits of paper to make a girls face.",

I got home the same time Graham got home and so did his mother, we went to go in but his sister, I think, was on the phone and we listened to her conversation which didn't make sense. We went inside and I cleaned up the sister's room with a piece of paper which sucked things up. I went to my room and was cleaning things up properly, when I heard someone whistling. Graham had opened my door a little and was whistling some song. I turned back around, but he continued whistling and it was annoying. I asked him what he wanted and he said \"a kiss\". It was just a 'peck' [Sims wise] but then it turned into a 'smooch' or 'makeout' (it was extremely vivid, and I can remember how it felt and tasted). I think earlier on in the dream, Graham and his sister had tried out this new trend, which was walking around naked, but Graham didn't like it. Also when we were all walking home, I hugged a pillar near the house and there was 'ae' written on it and I said \"I love a's\".",

People from Armstrong High School arrive. Some go down the hall to a different apartment, and some come in the apartment where I am. My high school classmates Olie Kecker, Brett Ball, and Arnie Heller walk in. They look down upon us because they think they're cooler than us: we are two different crowds. I greet Olie half-heartedly by saying, \"What's happening?\" Gino goes down to the other apartment. I don't want to be in these people's company so I leave quickly. I'm wearing socks but no shoes. I hurry down the stairs outside: I don't want anyone to know I'm leaving. I look for my truck, but can't see it at first. I'm not sure where I parked. I walk down the road to find it. There is a very pale woman with whitish blond hair who calls me over and tells me that back near or at the apartment there is a cat that got nailed down. I think I should go help it. I see my truck. I'm going to get my truck and go back to help the cat. The woman says she's going to go help the cat, so I run for my truck to leave so I'm not near the apartment. The woman runs after me. I stop and turn around. I'm confused, startled, nervous, and scared about why she is following me. I don't know why she would follow me. I realize I must be dreaming. I punch a yellow truck. Instead of my hand going through the truck, as I expected, it hits the truck. I tell the woman she is a part of my dream and ask her what she represents. She doesn't answer. She becomes a spirit: non-tangible but visible. I engulf her, consuming her, integrating her. I walk on and see my mom. I tell her she is in my dream and ask what part of the dream she represents. She doesn't answer. I engulf her, consuming her, as well. I see three women. We are on the hill of 1st Street just west of Slope Avenue in Oak Valley. I stalk them, taking my time, poised.

         "Chimpanzee Chinese Girl  I'm riding a small bicycle with a gear shifter on the right hand grip of the handlebars. I am going down Oak Avenue in Oak Valley. The road is not in good repair: it is cracked and torn up. I ride near Dan Hellman's house and cross over the railroad tracks there. I may walk across the path, because it is not paved. I am riding up the road towards Bill's Barber Shop. I shift into an easier gear. I am at a house where construction is occurring. I have a front-end-loader on my arms. There is a pile of sand there. A man says they are done with work for today, and to leave the front-end-loader; we'll do more tomorrow. There is a screened in area with a chimpanzee in it. It wants to smoke a cigarette. I light it, but it burns too short. The chimpanzee is going to burn itself, so I slap the cigarette out of its hand and stomp on it. The chimpanzee needs to be locked up. I close the two doors on the porch, and lock the outside door. The inside door needs to be locked too. There is a hole and a latch for the inside door. I encourage the chimpanzee as it tries to lock the door. Then there are two loops that a latch must be inserted through horizontally. Then the two loops are two much larger circles, and the latch is a key, which the chimpanzee puts through the circles. When it tries to latch the smaller loops, the chimpanzee is a Chinese girl. There is a pumpkin nearby.  I'm at home. The boat is in the back yard covered with a tarp. My sister Heather and her friend Joanne have dumped out some of my beer by the boat. I think it was Miller Genuine Draft. My cousins Melvin and Rich Redding are there. We tip the boat up and Rich takes the trolling motor off the boat. I hold the boat, and tell him to be careful. The trolling motor has no steering head. I ask Melvin and Rich if I have used the boat since it has been wrapped up for the winter. I can't remember if I have. There is a canoe in our yard. It separates into two layers. I carry one layer towards the garage. Melvin carries the other.",

I only knew a few things that I had to do, and so I'm trying to manage this big dog and keep him under control, and get in this bus and this train. And then I switched to another scene suddenly where we were in a hotel room with Mom and Dad and these two strange girls, and it was a really small, like one-bedroom room, like they are. And the carpets were red, and the walls were kind of bleah, yellowy. And we were playing this game with like a bunch of letters and little design things that you were supposed to pull out of a box and make words. And whatever the words said you had to do. And Dad wasn't really playing the game. He was laying down in front of the bed, so whenever we were walking around, we had to step over him. And I was remembering how I was putting my personal stuff under the bed because I didn't want the two strange girls messing it up. And I don't remember too much about what words we were making in the game, but one of the girls like laid near my stomach and sat on my back and like waved a paint brush between my legs, and I was so scared because I couldn't kick; I couldn't get her off of me and I was afraid of what she was going to do to me. And, let's see, was there anything else? I don't think so. That was all there was.",

         "I can't recall much about the earlier part of the dream. Only two fragments that happened just before awakening. It seemed as if I were standing at some counter and looking toward some large TV set. The counter is somewhat like what we have at home, except that in the dream this was a longer u-shaped one. It seemed as though my children were sitting along this counter, and Lance was diagonally opposite me. At one point he began to cry and complained that Drake had done something to him. He was writing something on a pad and I said to him that he had started the situation by saying something or doing something to Drake first. Then for some reason it seemed it was supposed to be 9 o'clock on a Friday night and there was some show just starting. The show that was just starting seemed not to be one that we wanted to watch, and someone said something about getting a different channel. What appeared on the screen was a male Negro who was saying something about his not having done it. The person in charge was trying to get information about what had happened, and it seemed as if the setting were on the deck of a ship. Another male said something to the man in charge of the ship, which seemed to implicate the Negro again and then someone said, \"Well, we're right back to the beginning again,\" in terms of trying to understand how it began or what happened. Then the scene shifted to an apparent medieval setting as there were knights in armor sitting on horses. This one knight appeared to be talking to his horse's tail. There was some woman there dressed in very full and elaborate clothing and she said something to the knight and then began to ride away. The knight said something to stall for time and as she drove away, she bent backwards towards his horse and began to say something to his horse's tail. There was something about his horse's tail becoming entangled with an adjoining horse's tail. There was also some element in which the viewing perspective changed and it was something about if one slid a file forward and through it slightly, it would bump into the top part of one of the horse's legs, and this would cause him to start running. That's all I can remember.",

He was all psyched about it. It looked like a big waste of money to me. Anyway, I noticed my arm was getting really cold and tingly- sort of like a when you have cut off the circulation in your arm. The thing was though that it wouldn't go away. I started to worry and asked Mom about it. There was a little spot on the inside of my arm that looked like a little varicose vein. I felt like that was causing the problem. Like it was dried blood in there blocking my vein. I asked Mom to squeeze it for me. She squeezed it and it was very painful. The dark vein area shot out along the vein and spread. As I went inside to look at it the dark spot erupted and blood began pouring out. I couldn't stop it and so I screamed for Mom. I began to feel very weak because I was losing a lot of blood. There was blood all over the side of my face and in my hair and all over my clothes. I was taken to the emergency room where there was a long line of injured people. I had to wait and was on the verge of passing out. I was holding my arm in the air to stop the blood. The people in front of me did not seem as in bad shape as me but still they would not let me go first. Next thing I remember is sitting at the hospital and my arm was fine. The secretary guy asked if anyone wanted to make some money and work as a waitress in the hospital cafeteria. I said yes. Later on, I was hanging our the Bill, Mark, and Matt who I met at a tobacco store where I was buying some cigarettes and 4 used tapes for a dollar. They gave me a ride. I felt really out of it from the loss of blood so I was in a daze. We stopped somewhere and then they left later and forgot me there. I was really weak but I had to get home.

We were happy to see each other and exchanged things about what we were doing and planning to do. It seems I was living in the equivalent of Victory Village, rather she was, for I was in her one-room house and she was telling me how she had fixed it up. (No, it was my place, for she was commenting on how the drapes were too long.) From here it went, I believe, into that my husband and I weren't married, but were living together in a one-room sort of place like this -- it was his place, but I had moved in with him. My mother had been up once and caused a terrible scene, and I was fixing up a place under my bed where I could hide if she came back again when I was there. We were making love one night when I heard her cough and knew she was coming. My husband got out of bed and got some clothes on, but I stayed in bed. I didn't hide as I had previously planned. It was not my mother, but my daddy and my brother. They came in and tried to act as if they thought everything was all right and I was doing a quite natural thing, but it was obvious that they, especially daddy, were very upset. As we talked, I was slipping into my pj's under the cover. All of a sudden daddy got up and went outside and started vomiting. I knew it was because he was upset, but it made me mad that, if he was that upset, he should come and pretend that he wasn't. Our tiny house was now a VW bus fixed up, and he opened the door and vomited into the back of it. I got very mad and shouted at him, and he couldn't really understand what I was talking about, as if he didn't understand what he was doing and why. My sister-in-law and brother were both there now, and they all were preparing to leave. My sister-in-law and brother avoided my eyes as if they thought I had done something awful. Through this whole dream there was very little of this overwhelming guilt feeling that I used to have in connection with all of this. What I was doing seemed so right and their reactions seemed so far removed from what they should be, that I could not really feel that I was doing something wrong. The only real emotion I felt was anger at daddy, and then I felt that this was wrong because he didn't really know what he was doing.",

         "I was somewhere where I shouldn't have been and was trying to get out. I snuck into the front passenger seat of this car and hid on the floor. Brock got in the driver's seat and was talking to the 'owner' who was Frederick and I was trying to signal to Brock to not give me away, but he didn't even look at me. I realized that he was doing it to not give me away. The parking was underground and he had to drive upstairs, get out to get a key and come back to drive out. I had to get out at the first stop and I waited for a while and walked out. There were lots of people but I didn't see Frederick. I went outside and saw Brock's car pulled up on the side of the road. It was in like a city, it was day and overcast (or at least, it was very grey). His car was kind of like a ranger car and was light grey. I got in and as I did realized it was a dream. I said to Brock 'what are you doing' and I can't remember his reply but implied I would know. I reached over and ruffled his hair and was thinking we should have sex. He made a joke about the fact that the scene didn't change and that 'even my subconscious was rejecting me' and we both laughed and I said 'I can't even get laid in my dreams'. Then I kind of woke up but was in sleep paralysis. I heard Tristan and Frederick talking in my room and then it sounded as if Frederick was masturbating. I could hear the squelchy sounds and then I felt something warm land on my leg. Then I felt someone come close to my face and could feel the hot air from breathing on my face and they started sniffing me. My first thought was that Frederick was going to kiss me and then that maybe it was a dog. I was scared and tried to scream but I couldn't open my mouth or my eyes. I could see the veins in my eyelids pounding and all I could hear was this screech from my blood pumping. I slowly controlled my breathing and woke myself up.",

    "| **Perplexity** | Candidate text is unpredictable and diverges from reference distribution | Candidate text is predictable, fluent, and aligned with reference distribution | **Low** | < 20 (for good results) | Low perplexity shows that the candidate text is fluent, consistent, and aligned with the reference. |\n",
    "| **ROUGE** | More overlapping n-grams (e.g., unigrams, bigrams) and higher recall of key phrases | Fewer overlapping n-grams and poor recall of key phrases | **High** | 30–50 (good), 50+ (very good) | High ROUGE suggests greater similarity between the candidate and reference texts. |\n",
    "| **BERTScore** | Strong semantic similarity between the candidate and reference text | Weak semantic similarity between the candidate and reference text | **High** | 0.85–0.98 (good) | Higher BERTScore reflects that the candidate preserves the meaning of the reference text. |\n",
