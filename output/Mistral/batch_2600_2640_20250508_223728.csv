Hugo was in front of me and directly under it, so I quickly went back and got up and yelled at the conductor to stop, but it was too late and we all fell into the water (the train too).

The dream describes a situation where you and Hugo were trying to get somewhere after a stocktake, but the streets were closed off due to a parade/march. You had to crouch and walk under a train to get there. The end of the track was over water, and you all fell into the water when the train started.

The dream symbols in the dream are as follows:
- Marching: The parade/march in the dream symbolizes teamwork, conformity, and structure.
- Railroad: The railroad in the dream indicates that you have laid out a set track toward achieving your goals.
- Railroad Crossing: The train in the dream represents your progress, and the conductor's signal and the subsequent fall into the water symbolize temporary setbacks or obstacles that you may encounter on your path to achieving your goals.

The dream suggests that you and Hugo are working together to achieve a common goal, but you encounter temporary setbacks or obstacles that may hinder your progress. The dream may also indicate that you need to be more aware of the subconscious issues or feelings that may be preventing you from making progress in your goals. The dream may also suggest that you need to be more disciplined and focused in your approach to achieving your goals.

Alternatively, the dream may indicate that you are trying to force your progress in a situation or relationship that is not meant to be linear or rigid. The dream may be a call to go off track and explore other possibilities. The dream may also indicate that you need to acknowledge and confront the subconscious issues or feelings that may be preventing you from making progress in your goals.

Overall, the dream suggests that you need to be more aware of the obstacles that may be standing in your way toward achieving your goals and find ways to overcome them. The dream may also indicate that you need to be more disciplined and focused in your approach to achieving your goals. Alternatively, the dream may suggest that you need to go off track and explore other possibilities to make progress in your goals."

The dream is about feeling rejected and excluded. The girl in the dream represents a part of yourself that you have not acknowledged or accepted. The fact that she has never been to your house before symbolizes that this part of yourself is new and unfamiliar to you. The criticism she makes about the dinner and the water symbolizes your own self-criticism and the feeling that you are not meeting your own expectations or the expectations of others. The fact that your father hogged the water pitcher represents your own feelings of being deprived or not getting enough of what you need. The paranormal aspect of the dream suggests that you are refusing to take responsibility for your actions and feelings. The dream is urging you to acknowledge and accept this part of yourself and to take responsibility for your emotions and actions. The dream may also be a reflection of your feelings of being cut off from social/family ties and feeling lonely and depressed. The dream may also be a call to take care of yourself emotionally and to provide yourself with the nourishment and support that you need."

The dream starts with you being on a train, which can symbolize a journey or a transition in your life. Seeing the characters from One Tree Hill on the train suggests that you are reminiscing about the past and the memories associated with it. Hilarie Burton sitting next to you and talking to her represents a connection or a bond that you have with someone from your past.

The next part of the dream involves you being in a car with your mom and having a large amount of cash. This can symbolize a windfall or an unexpected financial gain. However, the fact that you and your mom have no bags or shoes and pack your stuff in a towel suggests that you are not prepared for this sudden wealth and may be feeling overwhelmed or unsure of how to handle it. The police checking the car and finding some notes sticking out may represent feelings of guilt or unease about the source of the money.

The dream then shifts to a movie or show where a black guy and a kid look alike and are in it. This can symbolize a situation where you are seeing similarities between two people or things and may be feeling confused or unsure of how to proceed. The fact that the kid wasn't happy about leaving again may represent feelings of attachment or a desire to hold on to something or someone.

The dream ends with Hilarie being there with you again and there being chaos and clutter around her. This can symbolize feelings of disorganization or chaos in your life. Alternatively, it may represent a connection or a bond that you have with someone that is messy or complicated.

Overall, the dream may be suggesting that you are going through a transition or a journey in your life and are feeling overwhelmed or unsure of how to handle the changes. It may also be indicating that you are holding on to memories or connections from the past that are causing confusion or chaos in your present situation. The dream may be encouraging you to let go of the past and focus on the present, while also reminding you to be prepared for any unexpected changes or windfalls in your life."

The dreamer is experiencing a crowded and chaotic environment, filled with people and a lack of personal space. This can symbolize feelings of being overwhelmed and a lack of control in her waking life. The dreamer's subconscious is trying to convey that she needs to take a break and focus on her own needs.

The dreamer's interaction with the boy in the dream represents repressed emotions and feelings that she is not dealing with in her waking life. The dreamer is teasing and playing with the boy, but ultimately rejects him, indicating a fear or guilt about her past actions or thoughts.

The dreamer's inability to smell the perfume in the dream represents a lack of clarity or understanding about a situation in her waking life. She is panicky and unsure of how to proceed, indicating a need for more information or a different perspective.

The dreamer's hallucination of being in bed with the boy can represent a fear of losing control or a fear of being vulnerable. The dreamer's cold rejection of the boy indicates a fear of being hurt or betrayed.

The dreamer's observation of the boy going to the bathroom and wondering if he will use her yellow towel represents a fear of losing her personal belongings or a fear of being invaded.

The dreamer's hallucination of red carnations and a gold perfume bottle can represent memories or past experiences that are still affecting her in her waking life. The gold perfume bottle may represent a desire for wealth or success, while the red carnations may represent love or passion.

Overall, the dream is indicating that the dreamer needs to take a break and focus on her own needs, while also dealing with repressed emotions and feelings from her past. The dream is also suggesting that the dreamer needs to be more aware of her surroundings and to take responsibility for her actions."

The dream describes a situation where Al Lasko is going to Russia as an American soldier. He is aware of the potential danger and gives a card to Ann as a precaution. The presence of Stalin and the boundary line between their countries indicates a power struggle and conflict. The high banks of Stalin's country and the low banks of America suggest that he has an advantage and is trying to manipulate the situation to his favor. The water gushing out and breaking down the wall of rock represents the power of nature and the potential for change. However, Stalin's sabotage of the water source indicates his intention to use this power against America.

Ann being nude in the clear water represents her vulnerability and the need for protection. Al Lasko shielding her from the water suggests his desire to protect her and keep her safe. The string of barbed wire strung across their shanty represents the difficulties in communication and the challenges in breaking through to someone.

The presence of Ray Lasko and other small men with long coats suggests the presence of authority figures or people in positions of power. They may be trying to control or manipulate the situation. The dream may be indicating the need to be aware of these individuals and their intentions.

Overall, the dream suggests a power struggle and conflict between two entities, with one trying to manipulate and control the situation to their advantage. It also highlights the need for protection and the importance of communication and understanding in relationships. The dream may be indicating the need to be aware of the intentions of those in positions of power and to protect yourself and those you care about."

The dream is about finding a good pair of shoes, specifically suede shoes. The dreamer was initially skeptical about buying a pair due to her past experiences with the material. However, she was reassured when she saw someone else's pair of worn-out but high-quality suede moccasins. The dreamer felt great relief and enthusiasm upon finding out that the shoes could be washed and still look new.

The dream symbols in this dream do not directly apply to the dream's interpretation. However, we can make some connections based on the themes of the dream. The dreamer's initial skepticism about buying suede shoes can be related to the symbol of pajamas, which represents the need for rest and relaxation. The dreamer was not fully trusting the quality of the shoes, and she needed to take her time to find a good pair. The relief and enthusiasm she felt upon finding a good pair can be related to the symbol of sandals, which signify comfort and ease.

Additionally, the dreamer's discovery of someone else's high-quality suede moccasins can be related to the symbol of underwear, which represents hidden aspects of oneself. The dreamer was able to see the hidden quality of the shoes by observing someone else's pair. This discovery allowed her to overcome her skepticism and find a good pair for herself.

Overall, the dream can be interpreted as a symbol of finding hidden quality or value in something, despite initial skepticism or doubts. The dreamer was able to overcome her hesitation and find a good pair of shoes, which represented comfort, ease, and a sense of relief."

The dream starts with Dora, who is a symbol of societal expectations and ideals. She is fat in the dream, which may represent feeling overwhelmed by these expectations. However, Dora is not going to stay that way, suggesting that these expectations are not permanent and can be changed. The red racing stripes on Dora's face when she is gone may represent the negative effects of trying to meet these expectations, or the negative self-image that can result from them.

The dream then shifts to hearing the best band in the world in Charleston. This may represent a desire for pleasure and indulgence, or a longing for a simpler, more carefree time in life. The fact that it is not free may indicate that this pleasure or indulgence comes at a cost, or that it is not easily attainable.

The dream then shifts again to Dora being gone and Dora working on the assembly line of a factory. This may represent a feeling of being stuck in a routine or a monotonous job. The toy that comes through, which is a small machine gun sized squirt gun filled with Gatorade, may represent a desire for excitement or a need for a break from the routine. The fact that it is the last one and that it is made of see-through milkfish plastic may indicate that this excitement or break is fleeting and temporary.

The dream ends with the dreamer trying to get the toy for Rudy, who may represent a friend or loved one. This may represent a desire to bring joy and pleasure to others, or a feeling of responsibility to do so. Alternatively, it may represent a feeling of wanting to share in the excitement or pleasure with someone else.

Overall, the dream may represent a feeling of being overwhelmed by societal expectations, a longing for pleasure and indulgence, and a desire for excitement or a break from the routine. It may also represent a feeling of wanting to bring joy and pleasure to others."

The dream starts with a conference, which symbolizes a gathering of people with a common goal or interest. The presence of Suzanne Sterme and Clayton Thome in the dream suggests that there are two aspects of your life that are coming together or merging. The engagement of Suzanne and Clayton represents the union of these two aspects.

The swimming part of the dream symbolizes the challenges and obstacles that you have to overcome in life. The steep, almost vertical hill represents the difficulties that you face in your life. Your tense and fearful feelings indicate that you are not confident in your ability to handle these challenges. The loud and strained motor sound suggests that you are putting in a lot of effort to overcome these obstacles.

The exciting or dangerous event in the dream represents the thrill and excitement that comes with overcoming challenges. However, you cannot remember the details of this event, which suggests that you may not fully understand or appreciate the significance of this experience.

The dream also contains symbols of competition and racing, which may indicate that you are striving to get ahead in life or to win in some aspect of your life. The ramp symbolizes your determination and ambition to achieve your goals. The vertigo symbolizes your feelings of anxiety and discomfort in the face of these challenges.

The dream also contains a symbol of racism, which may indicate that you are being judgmental or discriminatory in some situation in your waking life. Alternatively, it may reflect your own feelings of being dismissed or cast aside.

Overall, the dream suggests that you are facing challenges in your life and are putting in a lot of effort to overcome them. You may be experiencing feelings of anxiety and discomfort in the face of these challenges, but you are determined to succeed. The dream also suggests that you may be judgmental or discriminatory in some situation in your waking life."

### Dream:

This dream is about a carpool trip to the university for a test, and the events that transpired during the journey. The dreamer is with Classmate-M-16, Jakob, Leilani, and Verity. The dreamer is feeling anxious about the upcoming test, and is considering taking the train instead of carpooling. However, they end up in a car with Classmate-M-16 at the wheel.

The dream then shifts to the topic of the test itself, with the dreamer and Classmate-M-16 discussing their past performance on tests. The dreamer mentions that Verity had been on holidays for two weeks and had performed poorly on a chemistry test, to which Classmate-M-16 responds with a dismissive ""Izzy!""

The dream then shifts again to the topic of music, with the dreamer and Classmate-M-16 singing along to a song on the radio. The song is described as a cross between ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" and ""Hot Blooded"" by Foreigner. The dreamer then hears an ad for yoghurt and a Burn Notice competition.

The dream ends with the dreamer and their classmates arriving at the university and preparing for the human biology test. Mr. Epstein enters the room and announces that calculators are allowed in the test, as long as they don't ""take up time."" The dreamer then raises their hand to ask about a question on the test.

The symbols in this dream are:
- Campus: The dreamer is on a mental journey to expand their knowledge and challenge themselves.
- Temptation: The dreamer is considering taking the train instead of carpooling, representing a conflict between their desire for instant gratification (taking the train) and long term goals (carpooling with classmates).
- Deja Vu: The dreamer's response to Verity's poor performance on the chemistry test is dismissive, indicating an unresolved issue that they are not addressing.
- Taffy: The dream does not contain any instances of taffy.

The dream can be interpreted as a representation of the dreamer's anxiety and conflicted feelings leading up to the human biology test. The dreamer is considering taking the easy way out (taking the train) instead of putting in the effort"

I realized I was late for school and said to hurry, but nobody did so I didn't bother going."," - Abandonment:  To dream that you are abandoned suggests that it is time to leave behind past feelings and characteristics that are hindering your growth. Let go of your old attitudes. A more direct and literal interpretation of this dream indicates you have a fear of being deserted, abandoned, or even betrayed. It may stem from a recent loss or a fear of losing a loved one. The fear of abandonment may manifest itself into your dream as part of the healing process and dealing with losing a loved one. It may also stem from unresolved feelings or problems from childhood. Alternatively, the dream indicates that you are feeling neglected or that your feelings are being overlooked. Perhaps the dream is a metaphor that you need to approach life with 'reckless abandon' and live more freely.
 - Father:  To see your father in your dream symbolizes authority and protection. It suggests that you need to be more self-reliant. Consider also your waking relationship with your father and how aspects of his character may be incorporated within yourself.
 - Haunted:  To dream that you are being haunted indicates early unpleasant traumas and repressed feelings or memories. You are experiencing some fear or guilt about your past activities and thoughts.
 - Haunted House:  To dream of a haunted house signifies unfinished emotional business related to your childhood family, dead relatives, or repressed memories and feelings.
 - Past Life:  To dream that you have a past life indicates greater awareness of your subconscious. You are seeking for better understand of your Self and of your origins. The past life may reflect an actual past life or it may be the life that your parents or grandparents or ancestors were living. Alternatively, the dream refers to previous lessons that you can learn from. You are open to rectifying current issues in order to move forward.","### Instruction:

We went in and he had moved in already and it was different from the pictures. Dad asked me how I liked it and I was like 'eh'. I asked where I was supposed to put all my stuff and he started going on about how I could ""ship it back to the US"". Mom had some pencils which had recordings from some young boy called Christopher who had played with snow. I cried and yelled at Dad saying 'what about my stuff, what if I want to live here' etc and that I loved the old house. I saw Tigger and gave her a pat. Mittens was in a cupboard in the kitchen. Ezra said that he liked the new place. I realized I was late for school and said to hurry, but nobody did so I didn't bother going.

### Symbols:
- Abandonment:  To dream that you are abandoned suggests that it is time to leave behind past feelings and characteristics that are hindering your growth. Let go of your old attitudes. A more direct and literal interpretation of this dream indicates you have a fear of being deserted, abandoned, or even betrayed. It may stem from a recent loss or a fear of losing a loved one. The fear of abandonment may manifest itself into your dream as part of the healing process and dealing with losing a loved one. It may also stem from unresolved feelings or problems from childhood. Alternatively, the dream indicates that you are feeling neglected or that your feelings are being overlooked. Perhaps the dream is a metaphor that you need to approach life with 'reckless abandon' and live more freely.
 - Father:  To see your father in your dream symbolizes authority and protection. It suggests that you need to be more self-reliant. Consider also your waking relationship with your father and how aspects of his character may be incorporated within yourself.
 - Haunted:  To dream that you are being haunted indicates early unpleasant traumas and repressed feelings or memories. You are experiencing some fear or guilt about your past activities and thoughts.
 - Haunted House:  To dream of a haunted house signifies unfinished emotional business related to your childhood family, dead relatives, or repressed memories and feelings.
 - Past Life:  To dream that you have a past life indicates greater awareness of your subconscious. You are seeking for better understand of your Self and of your origins. The past life may reflect an actual past life or it may be the life that your parents or grandparents or ancestors were living. Alternatively, the dream refers to previous lessons that you can learn from. You are open to rectifying current issues in order to move forward.

The dream is about feeling abandoned and betrayed by your father, who represents authority and protection. You are feeling neglected and overlooked, and you are experiencing fear and guilt about your past activities and thoughts.

The fact that you see Tigger and give her a pat suggests that you are feeling comforted and supported by a friend or a pet. The fact that Mittens is in a cupboard in the kitchen suggests that you are keeping your emotions hidden and that you need to express them.

 - Tentacles:  To see tentacles in your dream symbolize unknown danger lurking from the depths of your subconscious.

The dream starts with a flirty message from Benjamin, which is a sign of a romantic interest. The two links to his favourite sport scenes indicate that he is trying to impress you with his interests and that he is trying to win your heart. The fact that he mentions 'this is when my love for you grew over 24 hours' or 'I like this less than you' suggests that he is unsure of his feelings and is trying to gauge yours as well.

The scene at the back of a zoo thing, where there used to be lots of trees but now there were none, symbolizes a change in your environment or a change in your life. The elephants in the exhibit represent the need for patience and understanding, as well as the need to let go of the past. The Natives snuck through a hole in the fence and sat at the top of this hill symbolizes the need to be aware of the unknown and to be cautious.

The young boy taking a can of cat food out of your bag and you grabbing it back represents a desire to protect what is yours. The mother coming down and grabbing Mom's food and shoving it all in her mouth symbolizes a feeling of being overwhelmed or feeling like you are losing control.

The scene where you ask for the police and they send a lady who dealt with Natives represents a need for understanding and communication in a situation where you feel powerless.

The game you are playing represents a situation in your life where you are trying to navigate through unknown territory. The alarm butting and not knowing what it means represents a feeling of unease or anxiety. The octopus pulling Rover down symbolizes a feeling of being overwhelmed by emotions or a situation that you are unable to control. The game resetting symbolizes a need to start over or to find a new solution to the problem at hand.

Overall, the dream suggests that you are in a romantic situation where you are unsure of your feelings and are trying to gauge the other person's feelings as well. It also suggests that there is a change in your environment or in your life that is causing feelings of unease or anxiety. The dream encourages you to be patient, to let go of the past, and to communicate effectively in order to navigate through the situation."

The dreamer is in a foreign land, Vietnam, and is lost. This could represent feeling lost in life or in a situation. The dreamer comes across an American with a fishing line, which came from Texas. This could symbolize a connection to the past or a connection to a familiar place. The dreamer then takes the lead and finds a well-tended clearing, which reminds him of Maplewood Park. This could represent a sense of peace and calmness.

However, the dream then takes a darker turn as the dreamer is in a trench with a machine gun, ready to fire on Americans. This could represent feelings of aggression and anger towards others. The dreamer does not want to kill them, indicating a sense of guilt or remorse.

The dream may be a reflection of the dreamer's inner conflict between feeling lost and wanting to find peace, while also feeling angry and aggressive towards others. The dream may be a call to address these conflicting emotions and find a way to move forward in a positive and peaceful way.

The symbols in the dream, such as the fence, land mine, and machine gun, all represent obstacles and stressors in the dreamer's life. The dream may be a reminder to take care of oneself and find ways to overcome these obstacles and reduce stress.

Overall, the dream may be a call to find inner peace and address conflicting emotions, while also being mindful of the obstacles and stressors in life."

The dream starts with you going to another house and finding a dead relative/friend's remains in the form of a dildo. This could represent your feelings of guilt and shame about your sexual desires and past experiences. The fact that someone else had sex with it could symbolize your fear of being judged or found out for your sexual explorations.

The older brother in the dream could represent a part of yourself that you have outgrown or left behind. The dog in the cages could symbolize your fear of being trapped or confined. The feral dog getting out and following you could represent your fear of the unknown and the potential danger it may bring. The fact that it got hit by a car could symbolize your fear of death or the end of something.

The orange juice in the dream could represent an offer or opportunity that you are not interested in. The fact that you only drink water could symbolize your preference for simplicity and purity.

The desert in the dream could represent a barren and empty place within yourself. The Arabic men could represent foreign or unfamiliar aspects of yourself that you are not yet ready to accept or understand. The gun could represent a weapon or tool that you may need to use to defend yourself or overcome a challenge. The pyramid could represent a structure or belief system that you have built up around yourself. The quicksand could represent a situation that is threatening to pull you under and the need to act quickly to avoid being consumed. Your decision not to activate the thing could represent your fear of change or the unknown.

Overall, the dream could be a call for you to confront your feelings of guilt and shame about your sexual desires and past experiences. It could also be a reminder to not judge yourself or others for their sexual explorations and to not let fear of judgment or death hold you back from experiencing life to the fullest. The dream could also be a call to accept and understand foreign or unfamiliar aspects of yourself and to be prepared for challenges and change."

The dream is about your current living situation and your feelings towards it. The fact that you were expelled from the building for not attending a military training lecture indicates that you feel like you are not meeting the expectations of your current living situation or the people in it. You may feel like you are not living up to the standards that are being set or that you are not being true to yourself.

The trashed room and the hot tub next to it suggest that there are aspects of your life that are out of control and causing chaos. The fact that you didn't lock the door also indicates a lack of responsibility and care for your belongings and your living space.

The landlord in the dream represents the part of yourself that is in control and the responsible side of your psyche. The fact that you were expelled from the building indicates that you need to show more restraint and control in certain areas of your life.

The tenant list going all girls from now on suggests that you may be feeling a sense of competition or jealousy towards other women in your life. Alternatively, it may indicate that you are ready to form committed relationships with women.

The exploration of the structure with your boyfriend Jeremy represents your desire to explore new experiences and opportunities in your relationship. The narrow, dark little tube suggests that these new experiences may be challenging and uncomfortable, but ultimately worth the effort.

Overall, the dream suggests that you need to take more responsibility for your living situation and your actions. It may be time to make some changes and set new standards for yourself. Additionally, the dream may indicate that you need to be more aware of your feelings towards other women and form more committed relationships."

The dreamer is experiencing a fear or guilt about past activities and thoughts. He is haunted by these memories and is trying to avoid a near death experience, a relapse of sorts. The dreamer is on a set track toward achieving his goals, but he is being confronted with obstacles. He is trying to avoid these obstacles and is running after a boxcar, which may represent a situation or relationship in his waking life. The dreamer is trying to take control of the situation, but he may be too linear and rigid in his thinking. He may need to go off track and explore other possibilities. The dreamer is not letting these obstacles get in his way, but he may be experiencing temporary setbacks. The dreamer is not letting someone else exert their power over him, as indicated by the dream symbol of the railroad crossing gate being up. The dreamer is in control of his life and is not being thrown from the vehicle. The dreamer may need to consider the progress he has made and not forget about his humble beginnings."

The dream is about sexual energy and inhibitions. The brothel represents a place where sexual energy is freely expressed. The fact that you and your friend went there together indicates that you are both repressed sexually and are looking to experiment. The three girls represent the three aspects of femininity - the pretty one represents beauty and attractiveness, the blonde one represents innocence and purity, and the dark haired one represents maturity and experience. Your friend choosing the pretty one indicates that he is drawn to physical beauty, while you choose the blonde one, which represents your own purity and innocence. The fact that the blonde one disappears indicates that you are not ready to give in to your sexual desires and are holding back. The new lady who appears represents a new aspect of femininity that you are attracted to - the mature and experienced one. The fact that you go off with her indicates that you are ready to explore new sexual experiences and let go of your inhibitions. The long time that the blonde one took to return indicates that you are holding back and need to let go of your fears and inhibitions in order to fully experience your sexuality."

I went in to visit the school librarian, Mrs. Roll.  I had ice cream in cupcake wrappers in a square container.  Mrs. Roll told me to take something out, so my 10th grade history teacher ""Mr. Martinelli"" would look foolish.  I talked to my classmate Meghan at lunch in the library.  The main lights were off.  Meghan told me how she used to do drugs.  I left the library and went into a bathroom on the left side.  It was 11:55.  It smelled bad.  Everything was blurry like a heat wave.  I was told to get out, the blower was going to explode.  I was in front of it, and the heat was blowing on my left elbow.  It blew up.  I was taken outside and comforted by a guy.  I wasn't supposed to put water directly on the wound, like a chemical burn.  It looked raw and was bleeding in spots.  I had a bloody nose, too.  My friend Day from badminton mentioned physics.  I was stunned.  When I awoke, my left elbow was sore and sensitive."," - Accident:  To dream that you are in an accident signifies pent-up guilt in which you are subconsciously punishing yourself over.

### Dream:
I was in a bathroom.  People were told to leave.  The hand dryer was out of control.  It was the last day of school.  I went in to visit the school librarian, Mrs. Roll.  I had ice cream in cupcake wrappers in a square container.  Mrs. Roll told me to take something out, so my 10th grade history teacher ""Mr. Martinelli"" would look foolish.  I talked to my classmate Meghan at lunch in the library.  The main lights were off.  Meghan told me how she used to do drugs.  I left the library and went into a bathroom on the left side.  It was 11:55.  It smelled bad.  Everything was blurry like a heat wave.  I was told to get out, the blower was going to explode.  I was in front of it, and the heat was blowing on my left elbow.  It blew up.  I was taken outside and comforted by a guy.  I wasn't supposed to put water directly on the wound, like a chemical burn.  It looked raw and was bleeding in spots.  I had a bloody nose, too.  My friend Day from badminton mentioned physics.  I was stunned.  When I awoke, my left elbow was sore and sensitive.

The dream starts with you in a car with your mother. This could represent a journey or a trip that you are taking in life. Darren being at the window suggests that he is a part of this journey. However, you are unsure of how he is able to stay there. This could symbolize that he is a constant presence in your life, but you are unsure of his role or significance.

The dream then shifts to you going to a guy's house and seeing cops across the road. This could represent feeling uneasy or fearful about a situation or person in your life. The guy getting in the car with your mother and her taking him around the corner suggests that you are involved in a secret or hidden aspect of this situation.

The dream then shifts to you watching Penn & Teller: Bullshit later. This could represent a desire for truth and clarity in your life. The fact that they are walking towards and then down a step could symbolize a descent into a deeper understanding of a situation or issue.

The dream then shifts to seeing a raven. This could represent betrayal or disharmony in your life. Alternatively, it could suggest that someone is taking advantage of your misfortune.

The dream then shifts to you and your mother being in a telephone booth. This could represent a message or advice that comes with a price. It may also point to your communication or relationship with someone and how it is taking a toll on you in some way. The fact that the phone booth is out of order implies that you are having difficulties connecting to others or getting your thoughts across in an effective way.

Overall, the dream suggests that you are on a journey in life and are involved in a situation or relationship that is complex and confusing. You are feeling uneasy or fearful about this situation and are seeking truth and clarity. However, you are having difficulties communicating and connecting with others, which is causing frustration and misunderstandings. The dream also suggests that there may be betrayal or disharmony in this situation, and that someone may be taking advantage of your misfortune."

The dreamer is at school, which represents learning and education. The dreamer is having a good time with friends at Ceasar's Pizza, which symbolizes enjoyment and pleasure. The dreamer finishes eating and is then taken home by his father, which represents the end of a phase or period in his life. However, the dream takes a turn when the dreamer is caught in a flood. The flooding represents a difficult situation or problem that the dreamer is facing. The dreamer's father, who is supposed to protect him, is also affected by the flood. This suggests that the dreamer feels helpless and unable to resolve the issue on his own. The dreamer's father maneuvers the car out of the water with the door open, which represents the dreamer's need to let go of something or let things out in the open. The dreamer does not remember much more, which suggests that the dream is incomplete and that the dreamer needs to pay attention to the situation and find a resolution.

The dreamer's use of the word ""laugh"" suggests that the dreamer needs to lighten up and not take things so seriously. The dreamer's use of the word ""lava"" suggests that the dreamer is experiencing strong emotions and anger. The dreamer's near death experience suggests that the dreamer is going through a difficult time and may be feeling like he is at a crossroads or making a decision that will have a significant impact on his life. The dreamer's waterslide suggests that the dreamer is being carried away by his emotions and subconscious.

Overall, the dream suggests that the dreamer is facing a difficult situation or problem and needs to find a way to resolve it. The dream also suggests that the dreamer needs to let go of some things and not take things so seriously. The dream may also be a warning of an actual, physical accident or a near death experience. The dreamer should pay attention to the situation and find a way to resolve it before it becomes more serious."

The dream is about feeling secure and loved, as well as a sense of freedom and self-confidence. The dream starts with you skiing with your family, which represents security and warmth. You are then shown a drop, which represents a challenge or a decision that you need to make. You point it out to your mom, who may represent your inner self or your intuition. The fact that she doesn't seem to notice or care that people are skiing in restricted areas suggests that you are not concerned about the rules or the opinions of others. This could indicate that you are feeling free to make your own decisions and choices, even if they go against the norm.

The dream then shifts to you being in a house with your friend and her family. The light going on in the house represents a new awareness or understanding. You are standing in a doorway listening to your friend and her father talking, which represents gaining insight into a situation or a relationship. You are not noticed for a while, which could indicate that you have been observing and learning without being intrusive. When you are finally noticed, it suggests that you are ready to be a part of the situation or the relationship.

Overall, the dream suggests that you are feeling secure and loved, and that you are gaining a new sense of freedom and self-confidence. You are making your own decisions and choices, even if they go against the norm. You are also gaining new insights and understanding into situations and relationships.

The dream starts with Bryson wanting to join the list of movies you are working on. This could symbolize a desire to be a part of your projects or to be included in your plans. The spreadsheet that Aunt Sally has made represents organization and planning.

The next part of the dream involves Nathaniel and Braden. Nathaniel's criticism of Bryson and Braden could represent feelings of jealousy or competition. The fact that you lied about your weight could suggest that you are trying to hide something or that you are not being truthful with yourself or others.

The dream then shifts to the movie 'I Killed [name]'. The fact that Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Shaun Micallef are in the movie could suggest that you are dealing with creative and imaginative people. The police chasing Micallef could represent authority figures or rules that are trying to restrict your creativity. The fact that Micallef is talking to the NAV system could represent the need for guidance or direction in your creative pursuits.

The dream ends with you watching TV and the movie 'I Killed [name]'. The fact that you are watching a movie about killing someone could represent a desire to put an end to something or to eliminate a problem. Alternatively, it could represent a need to confront and deal with an issue in your waking life. The fact that the movie is called 'I Killed [name]' could suggest that you are trying to eliminate a part of yourself or a behavior that is represented by the name in the dream.

Overall, the dream could represent a desire to be included in projects and plans, feelings of jealousy or competition, a need for organization and planning, and a desire to confront and deal with issues in your waking life. The dream symbols of a cast, Family Guy, a killer, and the law could represent inhibition, coping mechanisms, purification, and the need for restraint, respectively."

The dream starts with Ezra wanting a job and possible employers coming over. This could symbolize his desire for a new opportunity or a fresh start. Melanie appearing at the door could represent a past relationship or a past life connection. The fact that Ezra is unaware of her presence could indicate that he is not fully aware of the connection or that he is not fully acknowledging the past.

The camera in the dream could represent Ezra's desire to focus on the past or to cling to old memories. The Asian kid and Dmitri playing and the number thing on the video camera could represent past experiences or past lessons that Ezra needs to learn from. The fact that there is no cord to transfer the stuff could indicate that Ezra is having difficulty applying these past lessons to his current situation.

The mother's behavior could represent Ezra's own inner temptations or desires. The smokes around the house could symbolize his desire to indulge in unhealthy habits or to give in to his baser instincts. The SARS movie could represent a fear of illness or a fear of contagion.

Overall, the dream could be suggesting that Ezra needs to let go of the past and focus on the present. He needs to apply the lessons he has learned from his past experiences to his current situation. The dream may also be indicating that he needs to be aware of his inner temptations and resist the urge to indulge in unhealthy habits."

The dreamer is looking at the moon, which is a symbol of the subconscious, and it looks huge because of the light from a building. The light from the building represents knowledge or understanding. The dreamer wants to take a photo of the moon, which symbolizes taking a closer look at the subconscious, but the light is turned off. This suggests that the dreamer is unable to gain a deeper understanding of the subconscious. Later, the light is back on but taken away again, and it rains. The rain symbolizes forgiveness and grace, but the dreamer is unable to receive it because the light is taken away again. The dreamer is also joined by Mom and Darren, which may represent family or familiar people. The dreamer's inability to gain a deeper understanding of the subconscious and the inability to receive forgiveness and grace may be causing feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. The dreamer may be feeling alienated from those around them, as indicated by the UFO symbol. The dreamer needs to extend themselves and reach out to others for understanding and forgiveness. Alternatively, the dreamer may need to take a closer look at their own thoughts and emotions to gain a deeper understanding of themselves. The dream may also be a metaphor that the dreamer is feeling'spacey' or'spaced out' and needs to be more grounded and come back to reality."

The dreamer is experiencing a sense of fear and chaos in her life. She is feeling disconnected and powerless. The knock on the door represents a call to action or a change in her life. The twisters represent the challenges and obstacles that she is facing. The fact that they are glowing blue suggests that they are electrical or technological in nature. The dreamer and her mother are trying to outrun these challenges, but they keep coming. The dreamer is feeling overwhelmed and exhausted.

The dreamer and her mother come across a building, which represents a safe haven or a place of refuge. Inside the building, they encounter a peach twister. The color peach represents nurturing and comfort. The fact that it is a twister suggests that the dreamer is feeling torn between her need for comfort and security and the chaos and challenges in her life.

The policeman's statement that the twister is a computer projected image indicates that the dreamer is being given a wake-up call. She is being told that the challenges she is facing are not real, but rather a manifestation of her own thoughts and fears. The dreamer needs to take responsibility for her actions and put her thoughts into action. She needs to stop letting things happen to her and start making things happen.

The dreamer's near death experience suggests that she is feeling a sense of desperation and hopelessness. She is feeling like she is at the end of her rope and doesn't know how to move forward. The dream is encouraging her to let go of her old ways and embrace new opportunities.

Overall, the dream is urging the dreamer to take control of her life and face her challenges head on. It is a call to action and a reminder that she has the power to make things happen. The dream is also encouraging her to let go of her fear and embrace new opportunities."
